I love Paolo’s movies.\nThis one made me cry very hard.\nIt’s just so big and beautiful and sad and lovely and funny and weird and sublime.\nThanks uncle Paolo. Paolo Sorrentino’s Youth has the rare power to force recollections of the past as well as anticipations of the future, all the while keeping its viewer completely grounded in the present, grounded in its stunning and symphonic display of human emotion. Indeed, Sorrentino pulls the rug out from under his audience on several occasions throughout the duration of the film’s runtime, dragging them downward into the depths of dejection only to raise them back up, just as quickly, into the heights of pure laughter and joy. Watching this film is like being trapped in a game of pinball, only Sorrentino is the game player and his audience is the ball that he’s whacking in every which direction without the slightest… \nmore",

You have to concentrate. Hard. For the entire film. Alfredson gives you no easy routes, and you find yourself crossing your eyes in frustration. Is this a flashback? Is this guy dead? What's happening here? And yet despite how much effort you have to put in, the atmospheric approach makes it seem worth it. A malevolent, dreary London; a secret service turned corrupt bureaucracy. There are no James Bonds here, no glamour. Just paranoia, creeping cynicism, overwhelming nostalgia. Oldman's turn as Smiley is note perfect. Betrayed personally and professionally, doggedly pursuing the truth. \nGo in with your thinking hat on. It's worth it. \"It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has grown so very ugly, don’t you think?\" Bureaucratic barbarism, an empire on its deathbed, a movie about how state espionage is as tedious and soul-sucking as it is impotent and grisly.

This is an animated film years ahead of its time in that it pushed the boundaries of cinematic standards, garnering the dreaded X rating. There are some progressive social issues dissected briefly during some more intelligent segments, while the majority of the film deals with cartoonish proportions of sex, drugs, and nudity. It's a neat little early foray into adult animation that honestly in the end doesn't feel like it has much to say other than giving the middle finger to the MPAA (which isn't really a bad idea).

As his anger grows, he begins a slow descent into a nightmare that culminates in the most heinous of acts.\nI am Tasmanian.

Nature vs nurture, a bit of both? I'm not ready to fully analyse it, but I'll tell you that I almost forgot to breathe. It's incredibly unnerving, cold, and important. When it ended, the entire cinema was silent. Nobody wanted to make a sound. It felt like we were grieving. \nAs someone who lives here, who mourns for the tragic loss we as a State experienced that day, \nNitram\n wrecked me. it's good and it's important and i never want to watch it again It would be hard to overstate the fear that I felt in anticipation of watching Justin Kurzel’s “Nitram” (an experience that I’ve semi-deliberately avoided since its premiere at the tail end of last year’s Cannes). For one thing, Kurzel has a rare gift for soul-clouding dread. I was first introduced to his work through “Snowtown,” a film so all-consumingly grim that it seemed to suck the light out of the universe in real time, leaving only the projector beam as a hostage to bear witness; it’s the kind of thing that demands to be written about in the past tense, as the stuff of memory rather than something that could still be queued up on Netflix, because there’s no way… \nmore",

What remains though is the unfolding of a Mitteleuropean tragedy, which is hypnotically enchanting and slow, and on an intimate scale with cosmic flourishes.\nWerckmeister Harmonies\n is a distinctly political work, even… \nmore There is no comfort in the worlds created by Bela Tarr. He has the unique ability to create his very own universe within the stories he chooses to relate. Otherworldly, yet real, Tarr's earth is a singularly harsh and unforgiving place, a place in which he chooses to explore what we are and where we are headed.\nWerckmeister Harmonies is no different. In harrowing black and white we are transported to an anonymous Hungarian town, out of which life is slowly seeping away. It is a desolate place, struck by poverty and inhabited by people for whom life is very hard. While we follow mailman Janos (the focal point of the story), we slowly pick up snippets of how bad… \nmore Why do I hold \nWerckmeister Harmonies\n aloft as the greatest film I have ever seen? A huge part of it, admittedly, and the thing that makes me think it will remain my favourite film to the day I die, is its profound personal relevance. I first saw the film about 5 years ago now, at a time when my interest in cinema was in the very very earliest stages of blossoming. It blew me away. Takes that long, images that symbolic, music that intoxicating, scenes that spellbinding, meanings that elusive... it was far too much for my uninitiated mind to deal with, but I knew that it was changing me. What's funny is that I encountered it entirely by mistake:… \nmore",

To make money for his wife and child, he marries wealthy widows and then murders them. His crime spree eventually works against him when two particular widows break his normal routine.\nPost-war moral blackout: The end of the world, a totality in form/content, a thriller more Brechtian than Brecht. Tracing the history of the world between 1929 to 1945: Wall Street Crash leads to Great Depression leads to rise of fascism leads to atomic bomb. We've covered three of these since 2008, its no wonder Straub called it the best film of the last ten years. Utterly profound - a man born into poverty makes the greatest film about how capitalism destroyed the world. Chaplin's highest masterpiece. We're alerted to the first murder by the black smoke of an incinerator - this is the first post-Holocaust film. It's becoming a tradition for me to watch this movie after U.S. presidential elections. The last two have been incredibly depressing - seemingly engineered to extinguish any hope that a better world might be possible. Like anyone, I have sometimes turned to art for comfort, but in moments like this I don't necessarily want \"escapist\" art. Sometimes it's comforting to see art that's brutally honest about the mess we're in. In this movie, even the streetwalker who Verdoux chooses not to kill - the pure, virtuous creature whose optimism in the face of despair makes Verdoux briefly reevaluate his cynical worldview - only rises out of poverty by becoming the kept woman of a munitions manufacturer (\"That's the business I should have been in.\"… \nmore 85\n\"It's the approach of death that terrifies.\"\n\"I suppose, if the unborn knew of the approach of life, they'd be just as terrified.\"\nCharlie Chaplin examines the blood mechanics of capitalism - the politeness and absurd formality of evil. \nMonsieur Verdoux\n acknowledges business as a a typical function, but nonetheless a ruthless one. What a brave film to make, especially post-WWII. Chaplin's performance is quite a feat, as he reserves sympathy not for Henri's actions but for the desperation of the societal constructs around him. \n\"I have made my peace with God, my conflict is with man.\"",

And, it’s generally the later work that is better known, and more widely considered to be the masterpiece. But where “Third Man” is a peak of visual and structural cohesion, it is “Odd Man” that, even fumbling, grasps all the more powerfully at the soul. \nThe work depicts a seemingly small scuffle involving a subgroup of Irish Nationalists in Belfast.… \nmore This movie is real, gritty, and fantastic. I was expecting something more along the lines of \nThe Third Man\n, Carol Reed’s other highly praised work, but this film strikes a very different tone. It isn’t a traditional noir, it bares more resemblance to a pre code crime drama, yet having been made in the UK it didn’t have quite the same restrictions.\nJames Mason is fantastic, it’s not hard to see how he became a star. And Carol Reed’s direction is a cut above. Much like\n The Third Man\n, he is so great with lighting, especially at night. They both bear fantastic shots of men in trench-coats running down alleys backlit. Never gets old.\nWhile I enjoyed this one, I… \nmore \"In my profession there is neither good nor bad. There is innocence and guilt. That's all.\"\nPolanski's favorite film, and i can see why. on par with THE THIRD MAN, for me. muscular direction, an intriguingly lateral narrative... only stalls out a bit when it switches its focus from consequence to cause. also, young james mason looks like angelina jolie (squint, if you must). there's a criterion laserdisc, but i'm gonna need a criterion blu-ray.",

One of the things I like the most about Batman is his rogue's gallery, and while some of them are ridiculous and a byproduct of a specific era, you have other iconic ones like \"Joker\", \"Bane\", \"Riddler\" who are not only entertaining to watch facing Batman, but they are mostly known for being these psychopaths with their distinctive traits.\nAt the same time, you have characters like Mr. Freeze who is an incredibly deep, Shakespearean and poignant character whose motivations make you want to root for him at the end. Even though I think it could have been better if it had been longer and focused more on our antagonist, it would have ranked among my all-time favorite DC animated… \nmore",

Her naval officer grandfather, Henrique, who married her grandmother, Beatriz, on her 21st birthday, spent extended periods at sea, leaving her with six children. This is the beginning of a generational saga.\nIt feels like there have been two phases in my life when I earnestly looked to my parents and wanted to truly listen. One was, of course, as a child, when I was still in the process of becoming my own person and the world was so wide in a physical sense. Back then I relied on them to learn how to function in this world, asking questions like any child does and taking their answers at face value to the world I was still exploring.\nThe second is soon after finishing school, when nothing starts to make sense again as I realized the first two decades of my life in school prepared me for little else but school. Suddenly… \nmore Faz tempo que não vejo um filme com uma construção de planos tão lindos e minuciosos como em Metamorfose dos Pássaros. Se Pasolini teorizou o que chamou de Cinema Poesia, deveria ter visto isso aqui. Amor, poesia e paisagem.\nCatarina Vasconcelos parece encontrar sua encenação em algum lugar entre Agnès Varda e Kieslowski. Uma Agnès Varda menos impetuosa, com planos mais esticados e contemplativos em razão desse belo encontro com Kieslowski. Um Kieslowski porque dessa beleza contemplativa Catarina Vasconcelos encontra também a beleza do sutil, do detalhe. Filmar a nuca nunca foi tão belo (e o cavalo marinho como símbolo).\nO filme é uma janela para a vida. Melhor, abre-se as cortinas e percebe-se a paisagem do plano de nossa existência. Enxergamos a moldura, vemos o mundo, celebramos a memória. \"The dead don't know they are dead.\"",

There are brilliant elements to this film, but each is pieced together so incompetently that it fails to tell a coherent story. There are simply too many characters that we are asked to care for, and where I understand that the filmmakers were attempting to show the different perspectives of the giant clusterfuck that was World War II, the synthesis of the stories wasn’t great, and some did not land how they were clearly intended to. It’s never really sure if it wants to be brutally realistic or melodramatically sentimental, and this creates a jarring discrepancy in tone, emotion and ultimate impact.

It's the first film by a Saudi woman and the first film to be shot in Saudi Arabia, but oddly enough, it's thoroughly Western in both its narrative and outlook.\nThus combined, \nWadjda\n becomes a film that is at once engaging and predictable, and depressing and uplifting in equal measure. The central performance by Waad Mohammed is the life and soul of \nWadjda\n, and although the adults often falter in their roles, Mohammed and Abdulrahman Algohani, the boy who plays her only friend, play wonderfully off each other.\nThe film is quietly subversive due to Wadjda's adroit manipulation of the society she lives in,… \nmore When you think about how much \nWadjda\n has achieved in history, it's quite a miracle that this movie was made. Aside from being the first film shot entirely within Saudi Arabia, it is also the first film to have been directed by a Saudi woman. But even to think that it will seem conventional from an outsider's perspective of Saudi culture, there's a much greater level to which \nWadjda\n speaks for because of what ground it breaks for their own society. It's a film that came right out from a country where we know that cinema in general had been banned for years, but the transgressive nature behind what we already can see as a simple coming-of-age tale is among… \nmore the first female-directed saudi arabian film. smart, affable, appreciably complex (which is a relief given the tone of the first act). wholly commendable, if never particularly involving.",

So despite this being perfectly sturdy it often feels a little thinly sketched and unimaginative… \nmore Based on the real life account of two lions that terrorized a rail road camp in late 19th century Africa, Stephen Hopkins' \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" is a tension-rich, old fashioned adventure. With its lovely savannah vistas, rousing score, and engaging characters, the film is fully appealing. It is a man versus nature tale where nature has the upperhand, unfolding with potent cinematic elements.\n\"The Ghost and the Darkness\" is built around the story of the turn-of-the-century lion attacks that killed over 100 people in an African railroad camp.

Basically, neither Hitler nor Bigfoot needed to be in this movie (spoiler: they barely are) and it feels distinctly like a cynical ploy to slip this schmaltzy nonsense under the radar of genre fans everywhere.\nIt's well shot, though almost unbearably slick, and the score is pure Zimmer-lite; all uplifting strings, swelling bombastically with emotional resonance.

It feels a little thematically trite but only because it's not after anything much more profound than genuine pathos.

Panahi has put together an unbelievably impressive stretch of consecutive works since his filmmaking-ban was put into effect — and \nNo Bears\n is right there among his best (my favorite). Every film since the ban has been a defining accomplishment in the medium, and a testament to his unwavering persistence, and to his belief in cinema and search for truth. \nNo Bears\n is his most complex film to date; one in which he explores many of the curiosities and ideas that his career works have… \nmore I swear when Panahi realizes he's on the border, Just about to exit Iran, and freaks out terrified of doing what would be the most logical thing for everybody else, I shed a single tear.\nHe's so afraid of having almost done something that lures him but ultimately doesn't feel right, ready to face persecution and (as It happened) jail, so scared of looking at that part of himself that wants to give up on his struggle, that moved me.\nWhat a man.\nAnd what a director.",

Incredible child actors and gorgeous production design. It never missed a beat and was shaping up to be one of the best Charles Dickens adaptations. The opening shot gave me goosebumps.

Never read Dickens myself, but every fibre of \nGreat Expectations\n feels bookish. No screenwriter would conceive this with a film adaptation in mind, a probably faithful adaptation at that. Structurally, it all fits together flawlessly. A little too much so; the way every element is a setup for a story beat or eventual twist gives Lean’s film a slight artificial quality I think (Pip loves Estella because she’s pretty, and because it serves the story that he does). Greatly entertaining nonetheless.\nPart of my April 2021 \nJane Austern\n challenge; 1st out of 10 films.",

Timothée Chalamet, speaking a mile a minute with a hyperactive mind and unshakable confidence, throws himself into the role with total commitment, emotionally and physically, crescendoing in a climatic moment that had the audience standing on their feet and cheering. The result is a performance and a film that feels as exhilarating, surprising, and nerve-shredding as anything Safdie has ever directed. The score is phenomenal, pulsing with otherworldly energy, while the kinetic editing makes the film’s two-and-a-half-hour runtime fly by faster than a ball ricocheting across the table. One of the most invigorating and best sports stories ever put to screen. nyff63 #10 (secret screening)\nchalamet oscar loading :) Absolute madness. Chaotic, funny, stressful, thrilling, surprisingly moving. Chalamet is on fire here: equal parts charming and infuriating. Really compelling lead character. The supporting parts shine too, especially Odessa A’zion. Arguably too long but the ending was such a left hook knockout for me that I’m not worried about it. We very much won.",

Genuinely puzzled, my daughters, whom I had brought with me to the screening, commented on the sea of graying feminine heads. Jane Austen, so the perception goes, is just for the ladies.\nI'm a fan of a number of Jane Austen adaptations, the Andrew Davies/Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth \nPride and Prejudice\n, of course, as well as the Emma Thompson/Ang Lee collaboration, \nSense and Sensibility\n. But even these adaptations don't quite do Austen justice, for as far as I'm aware, every straight Austen adaptation up until now (let's leave loose adaptations like \nClueless\n aside for the moment) have assumed that the love story is… \nmore A freakin' delight that understands the acidic satire and deep affection of Austen's writing more than most adaptations. Very, very dry and funny, never treacly, but not robotic. So, in other words, a Whit Stillman movie. 83\n \nWhat do you call someone who doesn't like this? \nA bit of a rattle. \nWhit Stillman's mastery falls in line with the confined structures and rooms of Austen's sharp, blistering snark, so it's only a matter of time before he tackled her work directly, settling into the plainly decadent hallways of Churchill and reveling in the quick wit of the tongue. So much delight in its airtight 93 minutes that it'll give you a contact high via the sheer extravagance of its mise en scène and the sly, sneaky women within it; a rearranging of a table controlled by buffoons.",

So… \nmore There's a killer on loose nicknamed the Phantom and everyone is scared shitless. It might be safe during the day, but watch out when nightfall comes in this old school extremely important entertaining slasher. Paperboy. The narrator has a silky smooth sounding voice.

I like how the Phantom walks. He walks like he doesn't give a fuck. Ben Johnson is the motherfucker and I'm pretty sure he taught Walker Texas Ranger everything he knows. Difficult to find car keys.

Nobody knows how it’s made or what’s in it, but people are lining up to buy it. It’s got a delicious flavor to die for!\n59\nI love how the premise of this movie is entirely based around a dude who saw a goopy, bubbling substance on the ground and said, \"I'm going to eat this.\" From the very first scene, where an old man finds a bubbling pool of white goo, exclaims \"What the hell is this!\" and immediately scoops some into his mouth, this movie is completely fucking bonkers. Perhaps the quintessential Reagan-Era horror satire, The Stuff offers a Capitalist Realist reimagining of 1950's Sci-Fi Horrors of being absorbed and controlled, primarily The Blob and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, realizing however, that corporate control of the food supply and the manufactured desire for its consumption offer an American Totalitarianism just as pernicious as any prior iteration. That this New Wave of Capitalist Totalitarianism may be set at war with the Older Forms of Paranoid Militarism is one of this film's many keen insights.

Although he’s hailed as a small-town hero, Dane soon finds himself fearing for his family’s safety when Freddy’s ex-con father rolls into town, hell-bent on revenge.\nAn honest hardworking man and a convicted felon cross paths in this tense as no other dirty grimy moody edgy dark thriller. Ray Donovan's old flame? Always keep your pistol in a shoebox. Dexter's short mullet. Cheap gasoline. Who remembers the typewriter? Bloody sofa. Who doesn't drink beer before noon? Gravediggers.

I'm not sure it's the best version of any of these genres but I was mildly impressed that in under 2 hours it was somehow simultaneously a good-man-goes-ugly \"righteous\" violence crime story, a cop conspiracy thriller, a vigilante rescue mission movie and then finally one of those old-school 70s revenge bloodbaths. Movies I thought about while watching this: \nA History of Violence\n, \nBlood Simple\n, \nHardcore\n, \nRolling Thunder\n. More modern movies should make me think about these kinds of movies. An endless orgy of twists & turns that begins & ends with a bullet being fired, \nCold in July\n isn't an easy film to pin into any genre because it starts as one thing, then changes its course around the middle, seems to be heading in the direction you predicted but once again takes an unexpected turn to become something else entirely.\nSet in 1989 Texas, the film tells the story of a local civilian who's all over the news after killing an intruder in self-defence, only to find his family being stalked by the ex-con father of the deceased.

The first heist in the original has a set-up element that feels so much cooler than this one, but I do love how extravagant of a plan the 1999 opening is for how simple Crown's involvement is in it.

Besides him, only a few hundred deformed, nocturnal people remain - sensitive to light, and homicidally psychotic.\nThe first third of this movie might be one of my all-time favorite first thirds of any movie. Charlton Heston, last man on Earth(ish), losing his mind, talking to himself, playing dress-up, shooting random mutants (From his cold dead hand!), watching WOODSTOCK in an abandoned L.A. movie theater -- does it get any better and sadder than that? The first half hour or so of this is amazing. Just Charlton Heston driving around a desolate LA in his convertible, brutally gunning down mutant vampire cults and performing to himself/random objects in an attempt to recreate the world before the implied nuclear apocalypse. (Including running a film print of \nWoodstock\n for himself and almost completely stone-faced remarking “they sure don’t make pictures like that anymore.”) When the plot eventually kicks in its mostly fine, however by trying to make this a broad action/adventure story it totally whiffs the novels morally complex depiction of a protagonist who doesn't realize he's dehumanized his enemies until they do it to him. “We mean to cancel the world you civilized people made. We will simply erase history from the time that machinery and weapons threaten more than they offered. And when you die, the last living reminder of hell will be gone.”\nI’m not the first one to say it, hell lots of the reviews mention it, but the first ten minutes are unbeatable. They’re so unbelievably compelling and eerie, it’s legitimately one of my favorite openings of all time.\nCharlton Heston drives down empty roads that get increasingly littered with trash, cars, and corpses.

Each action must have meaning, each coincidence must be a form a fate, and the dichotomies of our lives must be insightful into the way we lives. Like the titular \nOki's Movie\n, Hong plays with parallel tracks in order to see how different placements of atoms (characters) within the cell can create perspectives otherwise hidden. But here he acknowledges that outside of the fiction, quantum chaos rules these atomic parallels; these are just happenstance, and the formulas that seem to… \nmore",

I mean, I definitely prefer the Bale/Crowe/Mangold remake, especially given its vastly improved ending, but that titular “The 3:10 to Yuma” opening and closing song is pretty tough to beat. One of the great classical sentimental American Westerns nonetheless and more thrilling than you would expect. Glenn Ford sure was one cool customer.\nTop 50 Westerns All Time Felt like I could watch Evans and Wade converse for hours, so I was surprised when the final moments felt so comatose.

The filmmaker finds creative kinetic energy in the development of its chain of events, and this noticeably accentuates the impression of two worlds colliding for the central protagonist, portrayed wonderfully by Pinaki Sen Gupta and Smaran Ghosal at different stages of the narrative. \nThe dynamic expressiveness within the story is substantial, and there are multiple scenes which resonate profoundly, such as the scenes involving detachment from the family home and the complicated relationship with his mother. Karuna… \nmore In my opinion, the greatest moment in Satyajit Ray's \nAparajito\n comes when Apu goes to the train station, buys a ticket but never boards the train.

While Ray might not have intended this to address sexuality, the comparison between the witch hunts for communists and the manner in which America has treated homosexuality make it inevitable.

The intrepid journalist Philippe Guérande and his partner embark on a long crusade to put an end to the crimes of the Great Vampire and Irma Vep, his dangerous accomplice. (A ten episode movie serial.)\nAs I am working through the 1001 movie list, I decided to check off one of the more daunting entries.\nThis seven hour film is a collection of 10 episodes, ranging from 20 to 60 minutes. As it’s length put me off initially, I would highly recommend splitting it up by episode, and watching it like a TV show.\nIt is difficult to judge by modern standards of storytelling and filmmaking as this is practically the birth of narrative film, though much of it is still quite compelling and funny. Irma Vep creeping around in all black is definitely the highlight.\nThe filmmaker seems to not understand what vampires are though, or have made vampires something else entirely. The vampires are… \nmore \"The reality of this century. Beyond fashion. Beyond taste.\" - Andre Breton\nThe key to the film appears in the fourth episode, where after close to three hours of establishing surrealism and unmasking such as the real disguised, we see a bank clerk who will play an important part in this episode, talk of how he is a total 'film-fanatic!!' and go to the movies - at a Gaumont Palace, the same place this serial would have played. Feuillade, extending the inquiry from Fantomas, almost seems as though wanting to depict the false surrealist horrors as though they are happening in real time, but also formalizing the theatre itself as the social space makes clear a keynote of Feuillade's cinema:… \nmore \"\nHead still missing.\n\"",

Entombed behind a maze of flooded cave tunnels, they face impossible odds. A team of world-class divers navigate through miles of dangerous cave networks to discover that finding the boys is only the beginning.\nCan’t imagine being in the middle of production and seeing \nThe Rescue \nrelease beforehand I would scream 83\nRon Howard's middle-brow status has contributed to a fascinating filmography in today's Hollywood landscape. A three-star king. He's the guy you call when a Star Wars movie needs to get back on schedule, or if Dan Brown just finished another globetrotting Robert Langdon thriller. A clean, unfussy craftsman who rarely rises to excellence but still manages to satisfy on a frequent basis. So it's only fitting that he approaches the true-story narrative of \nThirteen Lives\n with his usual razor-sharp, clinical edge. If you're looking for an Eastwood-ian fix, Ron Howard has got you covered. This is his best film in at least a decade. With a strong, unassuming cast (Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, Joel Edgerton, and Sukollawat Kanarot are… \nmore Deeply suspenseful, downright Hawks-ian procedural of collectivism, spiritual community, and professional expertise.

To call it kind of awesome is probably an overstatement, but it's definitely \na kind\n of awesome. it's like fritz lang directed a mountain dew commercial vin diesel's self-image as the last great auteur actor, carefully cultivating an esoteric brand of genre dorkiness that both endears and alienates contemporary audiences & critics. \nthe chronicles of riddick\n is perhaps the apex of diesel's twin desires to both make big-budget mass entertainment and to indulge in an illustration of his offbeat scifi/fantasy obsessions gleamed via tabletop RPG campaigns, anime and videogames. while dominic toretto is diesel's most famous archetype, one could easily claim that riddick is the role that truly codifies diesel's strengths as a performer: his burly physique, the growled baritones, the dreadfully sincere yet still playful tone, the literal animistic magnetism, and especially the pouty rugged distance that makes him not always a strict audience surrogate, but… \nmore",

However, Maquia has always felt lonely despite being surrounded by her people, as she was orphaned from a young age. She daydreams about the outside world, but dares not travel from her home due to the warnings of the clan’s chief. One day the kingdom of Mezarte invades her homeland. They already have what is left of the giant dragons, the Renato, under their control, and now their king wishes to add the immortality to his bloodline. They ravage the Iorph homeland and kill most of its inhabitants. Caught in the midst of the attack, Maquia is carried off by one of the Renato. It soon dies, and she is left deserted in a forest, now truly alone save for the cries of a single baby off in the distance. Maquia finds the baby in a destroyed village and decides to raise him as her own, naming him Ariel.

Okada certainly has her own unique style-- one that has already proven offputting to many Letterboxd users and reviewers. But taking a look at audience scoring / reception of the movie, it's plain to see that she's onto something.\nMuch of \nMaquia\n bears a heightened sentimentality, bordering on maudlin emotional exploitation at times, but it never crosses that boundary so far as to alienate the audience. Even music cues that trumpet in at the height of an emotional scene do nothing to shake my faith as an audience member in Okada's vision, because… \nmore Spanish version...\n‎Muy linda animación sobre el paso a la madurez y la mortalidad.

A frase que é repetida algumas vezes \"Nunca se apaixone para não descobrir o que é realmente ficar só\" dá o tom dessa animação, afinal, qual amor é maior do que o amor de uma mãe?\nUm universo bem construído, personagens interessantes, um dragão que não chama dragão, mas Renato (Isso foi estranho) e a mensagem final que fica é \"Um filho não é um plano de previdência para cuidar de você na velhice, mesmo que você não envelheça \" ou \"Você cria os filhos para o mundo, não para você\".

Tscherkassky takes this footage from another film and creates something completely new and different, legitimately making it his own genuine work. He does this often in his films, using footage from another film and editing it into something else. A great example besides this one, is what he does to \nThe Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\n in his experimental short \nInstructions for a Light and Sound Machine\n, transforming its genre completely from a western into a Greek tale of tragedy.\nOuter Space\n is one of the most effective avant garde pieces of cinema that I have ever seen.

It is so intense it literally destroys the archive footage of 'the Entity' it uses. \nHow to go insane in 10 minutes.\nYep. Quite liked that. Peter Tscherkassky turns cinema into a battlefield. Using fragments of \nThe Entity (1981)\n, he not only recontextualizes a horror film but dismantles it until only the trauma of materiality remains. It’s a short in which the phrase\n “In outer space no one can hear you scream”\n takes on a new meaning: not just cosmic silence, but also about the silencing produced by the destruction of the cinematic medium itself.\nBarbara Hershey’s scream is not heard, like in the original film. It’s intended crushed by the noise of the projector, by violent superimpositions, by layers that invade the image until they dissolve it into pure optical noise.

A Cinema of Portraiture: now I understand what P. Costa meant when he told me he was thinking more of the Soviets than John Ford when he made Horse Money. There's an abstract quality to Dovzhenko's montage that seems to work against narrative rhythms; his story moves forward somehow or other, but at any given moment, he's likely to organize tableaus that illustrate his moment in a way that looks like folk art (tapestries, stained glass windows, Byzantine painting) while doing nothing to maintain narrative momentum. Best example of this is toward the end, when he crosscuts between 4 or 5 separate locations in a way that does none of the work of advancing a story, or even implying a sequence of events.

Those who have said so are absolutely correct; I'd place this up with \nCome and See, Salo, Zero Day, Lilja 4-Ever\n and \nIrreversible\n in terms of uncomfortable cinematic viewing experiences. It's an immensely rough watch, but fortunately as a viewer you understand that right from the first scene, so if you feel like turning it off... you can, right away, before the characters and the narrative pull you in and hold you captive.\nIn order to avoid… \nmore Arguably one of the most disturbing revenge flicks you’ll ever see. Probably the most Haneke film the Austrian director has never directed. \nThe cinematography has this cold, blue, and green-ish hue that adds to the repulsiveness of the film, a constant reminder of the depravity of both men. Really liked the way it also concludes, it drives home this idea that evil will never dies, it evolves. Navarrete’s score is very subtle but effective on creating this oppressive and sinister atmosphere that lingers and crawls deep into your soul. \nThe performances are fantastic across the board. Casting a man who made himself for playing Hitler in a series of projects was obvious but inspiring casting for playing this once vile… \nmore Adopting a palette of blues, greys, browns and blacks, In A Glass Cage creates a hushed, almost stilled atmosphere perfect for the nightmare tale it tells. This is a film for which a heightened, displaced sense of reality becomes more real than what realism as a style could possibly offer. Early on, it is clear that waking life is the dream of the nightmare, that what has been banished as past horror, that which must be put aside or temporarily forgotten in order to maintain the fiction of regularity, rationality, order, is the primary reality, the ground from which everything follows. The end of wartime is sometimes described as waking up from a dream, with a civilization able to put… \nmore",

It's times like this where I just hate ratings bc while it's very flawed, I can't deny how into it I was and how much it, again, disturbed me. Sheesh! Jigoku is without a doubt one of the most visually and thematically pessimistic movies in history. In the Jigoku world of extreme despair and torment, everyone sins and everyone deserves to be tortured forever in hell, and it certainly leaves nothing to the imagination when depicting the terrifying after life every living soul is inherently scared of.\nIn this daunting story of death-oriented nature, a car accident starts a malignant chain reaction, resulting in the death of almost every character that runs into its path.

É uma linda carta de amor para os fãs do original que diverte bastante e emociona ainda mais \nselton, matheus e tais artistas!!! Este é o Brasil da farofa da Gkay, do Vyni do BBB, do Carlinhos Maia, da moça do avião.\nOs sotaques, já exagerados no primeiro filme (o que entendo que é uma escolha intencional), aqui ultrapassam qualquer limite de bom senso. É tipo \nassim\n. O filme não oferece respiro: interrompe tramas antes que possam se desenvolver, jogando o espectador de uma cena para outra, o que me distanciou e tornou difícil me importar com qualquer coisa que acontecesse.\nExistem produções que sabem usar essa linguagem frenética, moldada pelo ritmo do TikTok, de forma eficaz. Mas essa é uma escolha que considero arriscada, que pode facilmente descambar para o desastre, como vimos em filmes como Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo… \nmore o filme foi dublado… o filme brasileiro em português foi dublado… tipo eles tão falando português… mas o som que sai não é sincronizado com a boca deles… pq foi dublado… dublaram o filme. Não tem força como filme autônomo e pega emprestado do primeiro basicamente tudo. É como se fosse um especial de natal, uma bela homenagem, uma celebração, algo diverso, mas não Auto 2. É difícil estar a sombra de um filme tão grandioso como foi o dos anos 2000, por isso entendo que boa parte do roteiro precisou se voltar ao apelo das primeiras aventuras para replicar momentos inteiros. Contudo, é por isso que o filme fraqueja.\nEsteticamente, o caminho escolhido do artificialismo é bom. Embora tenha sido a razão precisa pela qual tantos espectadores torceram o nariz para o filme, para mim tal aspecto entrou em total sintonia com as atuações marcadas e o ritmo muito forte dos diálogos, algo… \nmore nada podia me preparar para o chicó transmasc não mono namorando uma sapatão, a agenda woke não tem limites mesmo “Eu já vi esse filme antes” AÍ KKKKKKKKKKKKKKK DEI UMA RISADINHA — Meu amigo João Grilo!

Eu ri MUITO. Praticamente a cada diálogo entre o João Grilo e o Chicó antes mesmo deles falarem eu já tava esboçando um sorriso, eles são maravilhosos. Tanto nos temas das conversas, quanto na forma de falar, é um filme que diverte com muito pouco, e isso é muito bom! E dessa vez além deles também tivemos as boas atuações de Eduardo Sterblitch e Luís Miranda, que também proporcionaram boas risadas.\nSelton Mello e Matheus Nachtergaele, vocês sempre serão famosos. …Chicó é artista, a mentira dele se chama poesia É filme ou comercial da Brahma?",

Her chance for one comes when she is reunited with her long-estranged father, who intends to emigrate to Mexico and then enter the United States. Sayra’s life collides with a pair of Mexican gangmembers who have boarded the same American-bound train.\n‪Cary Fukunaga may have few features under his belt, but since this debut he’s proved himself to be the most eclectic shapeshifter in the industry (watch out, Ron Howard). Writing and directing for both films and TV, he has proven to be adept at every genre — \nManiac\n (quirky mind-bending sci fi that itself veers into myriad subgenres), \nTrue Detective \n(anthology crime drama) \nBeasts of No Nation\n (violent war biopic), \nIt\n (classic horror remake), & \nJane Eyre\n (Victorian-era literary adaptation). This year, we’ll even see his take on Bond (\nNo Time to Die\n). \nWatching \nSin Nombre \n— a gritty adventure / social realist tale of a Mexican gang member and a young Honduran teen hopping trains and kindling a relationship as they immigrate to America… \nmore Yet another phenomenal debut from a first time director. Tonight’s pick was a combination of influences. This is Thursday, which is the night we invite our neighbours over to watch either something we’ve seen and loved, or something we missed that was screened at TIFF. As it turns out, tonight’s pick was Lise’s based on her loving the film ( I didn’t see it ) and the fact that our neighbours were departing for a Mexican vacation tomorrow morning.\nMaybe that wasn’t the best pick, sweetie, but they sure did love it.\nThe previous Thursday we showed them Monsters and Men, an incredible first feature from director Reinaldo Marcus Green. Now tonight, another incredible first feature from Cary Joji Fukunaga.… \nmore Wow, what a great film. Sin Nombre is a beautiful simple story of two people who need to get a way from their lives. Willy needs to escape his gang, although he is fairly certain he will not succeed, and Sayra needs to get to New Jersey to start a new life in America. \nIn a fantastic debut, Cary Fukunaga gives us a glimpse into the world of illegal immigrants and the lengths to which they will go to get a better life. The film is real and gritty. Fukunaga doesn't shy away from showing desperation, but the film is ultimately hopeful without being sentimental in the slightest. As with the rest of the film, the characters are compelling and honest and very real. Sin Nombre is definitely one of the best films of 2009.",

The idea that all their hearts are pure, communicating with animals, and interacting with them is really nice. Even though I'm 20 years old, I’d love to try this with my 8-month-old cat at home because I'm her favorite person. However,… \nmore This is not a kid friendly premise. Eddie Murphy trying to hook up 2 bears to then be called a bear pimp is peak cinema. this is what Martin Scorsese is trying to save.",

But fate tragically decrees that the two lovers will remain apart.\nA perfect example of a film that tells a somewhat dull story, but makes up for it with ballsy, experimental (and perfectly executed) cinematography.\nI couldn't have cared less about the story, honestly. The acting was serviceable, effectively moving the plot along complete with some throwback silent film-style acting.\nBut back to the main attraction - the cinematography. Yuri Ilyenko and Parajanov nail it over and over again. From the beginning with the camera dropped from a tree crushing a man to the camera tracking the young boy trudging down the birch tree thick, snow covered hills.\nThe man striking the camera lens, blood rushing across the frame and morphing into blood red horses galloping overhead.\nThe zoopraxiscope-style images shrouded… \nmore Blood sprays the camera lens and suddenly the wisps of red are ribbons flapping on a pole. Christ is superimposed on stain glass. The camera rests statically on the roof around an open courtyard in wet autumn or frosted winter, watching rituals and daily routines. The camera swims through the air, following intense motion through bald forests. A doe sits behind a veil of trees next to a thin, wooden cross marking the grave of a lover. Parajanov's fevered mythic tragedy is a parade of images that, \nas some have pointed out\n, exceed the narrative they illuminate; a simple fantasy turned into a period portrait, a Carpathian church mural come to life. \nEdit: To say nothing of the incredible songs sung throughout, enmeshing the narrative in a folk fantasy.\nMarch count: 11/30\nCountry: Ukraine The Soviet films of that era — and not just mine — are like a cardiogram of terror. They are cardiograms of fear. The fear of losing your film, the fear of starving. You feared for your work.\nWhen Sergei Parajanov abandoned his fear, he left behind both Soviet realism and security; his every subsequent act — both personal and artistic — was one of defiance, and one the Soviet government was determined to punish.\nBoth artistically independent and bisexual, Parajanov was twice a target for the great forces of conformity, offenses for which he spend nearly five years in a work camp and nine months in prison.

Some movies are shot.

This is a pure art house biopic that scratches, pierces, and digs under the skin, confronting the viewer with a blistering emotional intensity that some may find too much to bear.

As he says his goodbyes at a friend’s farm, British Black and Tans arrive, and a young man is killed. Damien joins his brother Teddy in the Irish Republican Army, but political events are soon set in motion that tear the brothers apart.\ncillian murphy: yells in irish\nme: nods understandingly Revolutions are not clean. The British occupation of Ireland was barbaric and brutal. Whilst \nThe Wind That Shakes the Barley\n may be exaggerated according to some, it is hard to deny the oppression Ireland faced during centuries of occupation. Irish independence is still a prickly topic, but British actions in the 1920s were wrong and Ken Loach is brave for unequivocally showing that in his film, although it's sad that it does require bravery to highlight anti-imperialist sentiments. \nAs a film \nThe Wind That Shakes the Barley\n is one of unrelenting terror and bloodshed, filled with constant chaos. The working class accents and dialects are keenly preserved, all shouting over each other as debate and war never stops. However what… \nmore It’s about the horrors and contradictions of the Irish Civil War in 1922. \nI remember showing this in a community centre in our constituency, and Ken came to talk to us about how he made the film. Thank you Ken!\nSuperb performance by Cillian Murphy.",

Lawyer Richard Goodwin steps in and attempts to uncover the orchestrated deception behind the scenes.\nUnderrated Martin Scorsese performance Thanks to the wonderful people at American Cinematheque, I was incredibly fortunate to see a pristine 35mm print at the Aero with Rob Morrow in attendance. \nOne of my all-time favorite films, QUIZ SHOW hasn't aged a day since its debut in 1994. This engrossing morality tale about the true story of the scandal that rocked NBC staple TWENTY ONE is a virtuoso masterwork on every level. A uniformly excellent cast led by Morrow, then-relative-newcomer Ralph Fiennes, and the always wonderful John Turturro shine under Redford's kinetic, elegant direction. This portrait of the slippery slope of corruption, the power of values (and the consequences of compromising those values), and the destruction of the public trust in television feels timeless and… \nmore The ultimate WASPs vs Jews movie. As someone who is third culture kid split between these two traditions, this movie speaks to me. Honestly, if you're not from an East Coast, intellectual WASP family, you can never really understand the scene where Charles Van Doren drives to his parents' house in Connecticut in the middle of the night and wakes up his dad by drinking milk and eating chocolate cake and learns that his father had anxiety one time in his life about finishing a book of poetry. This is representation and it's not for everyone, but it is for me.",

The movies give Bud the strength to get through another day as he deals with his oppressive school environment and his burgeoning homosexuality.\nsometimes i wonder why we bother to make films that aren't in some way about *filmmaking*, that closed circuit, an infinite loop of stories about their telling, so explicitly speaking to the medium's true potential not for capturing reality but for destroying it.\nANYWAY, to sidestep a slipstream into all of my lost undergrad papers... I love how Davies uses dissolves in THE LONG DAY CLOSES, the basic tools of cinema transforming Bud into a ghost in his own memories. and LOOOLZ that \"tammy\" sequence. so rapturous you just want to stand next to your tv, point to the screen, and make something that approximates a robert deniro \"you lookin at this? you lookin at this?\" kinda face. \nhoping to write more, perhaps more coherently, for film.com next week. I still remember that feeling of first discovery being made for myself at a young age. I came across \nCasablanca\n on Turner Classic Movies when I was 12 years old, and it was a moment that changed my life. And prior to getting into movies, I still found myself a sense of comfort from playing video games. It was a discovery of feeling that has only furthered where I wanted to go with my own life, being behind a shelter the whole time at the fear of what public perception would have brought upon myself. I was only discovering what films could speak large volumes for oneself, no matter what sort they were. And if any other film had spoken… \nmore Interesting potential as a double feature with \nBelfast\n, though that would expose some of the flaws of Branagh's film. This is as interested in memory, sadness, and a sense of place as that, but much more engaged with the psychology of loneliness and finding solace on the screen. Davies' camera moves gently, gracefully even, in tandem with a series of extraordinary musical choices and bold lighting. I haven't loved all of Davies' films—I recall having an extreme reaction of disinterest to \nThe House of Mirth\n while studying Wharton in college—but this one's anti-propulsion is its' greatest strength. It's a series of overwhelming flashes, like dynamic still photography. There's a reason cinephiles worship this one, but it's still a full-blown masterpiece.",

They go to get a hamburger and Riggs finds a gang of teenagers with automatic weapons. Better yet, the two cases are connected!

If you have an issue with either of those – I don't think this film is for you.\nThat being said, I really enjoyed \nA Dark Song\n, particularly because of how different it was from other supernatural films based around rituals.

It's a film that rejects the illusion of an “\nexisting\n” easy redemption; it's a cry of despair against the gears of a system that, by imprisoning bodies, destroys souls.

This, too, is where the audience finds the convicts in “Brute Force;” a group perhaps rightfully sentenced, but serving a sort of punishment far outweighing their respective crimes. \nLed by the ever-charismatic Burt Lancaster, the men of the “Brute Force” prison make a pact to escape together; not necessarily because of the life that awaits them on the outside, but simply because it means being \nout\n of the prison. The institution… \nmore Between the sadistic guard captain and the intense escape sequence, this could have been a great film. Unfortunately, it wastes a lot of time on cheezy backstories for several of the prisoners that all seem to suggest they all went to prison for love. It seemed like a cop out after the brutality the film presented to show these as misunderstood, romantic men who just went too far for their women. \nStill, Munsey is a vicious villain. This film features some fairly gruesome moments of violence and death, and Munsey is at the root of all of them, one way or another. He's menacing, cold, and prim.

I've skimmed a couple of grand off the top.\nGerry Stanton: What?\nClive Cornell: 'Course it's fucking all there. This is the pay-off, yeah? We pay you off, you and your pals keep your fucking noses out of our business. That's the dynamic in this situation. Why the fuck would I then cheat you out your money? Eh? Why would I do that? That doesn't make any sense. That'd defeat the entire purpose of the fucking interaction. Fuck me!\nI can’t tell if this movie is “really motherfuckin' dumb, or really motherfuckin' smart“ but it was an entertaining movie about the American FBI agent played by Don Cheadle, who comes… \nmore He wasn't lying when he told the girls he had a tiny pistol \"\nNow now, lads. Not in front of the American.\n\"\nIt's pretty hard not to immediately hold The Guard up to In Bruges, what with both of those films sharing Brendan Gleeson and directors from the same family. But once you actually start watching it, it's a different beast altogether. Not quite as satisfactory, perhaps, but pretty damn close and a super little film in its own right.\nGleeson plays a small town Irish copper who, after being lumbered with a new partner from Dublin, starts to find his world crumbling around him as prostitutes, drug dealers, gun runners, the imminent death of his mother, and the arrival of an FBI agent (Don Cheadle) conspire to make his life more miserable.… \nmore A fair few people now have told me that this film is hilarious and is also a must watch considering I love Brendan Gleeson, aside from that tho I don’t have a clue what this film is gunna be about.\nYeah this film is just beyond barmy in the best way possible. \nThis whole film was just hilarious from start to finish. \nI can’t get the image of Brendan Gleeson walking around Disney World by himself out my head. \nIt also had a fairly decent small town cop/detective story to it as well, so if you like that sort of thing then u don’t doubt that you will love this one. \nMy Top 200 I thought blacks can't skiing? Or was it swimming?\nThe accent alone makes it 3 stars already if I'm being honest. Gosh I just love Irish. “Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, these men are armed and dangerous, and you being an FBI agent you're more used to shooting at unarmed women and children.”\nJohn Michael McDonagh’s feature film debut is as irreverent as the main character of this movie played by Brendan Gleeson who isn’t afraid of the repercussions his words might have on the rest of his peers. Gleeson plays an unorthodox Irish policeman of a small local community who when attending a meeting with an American FBI agent played by Don Cheadle makes a number of racist remarks such as “I thought only black lads were drug dealers?” and then justifies his behavior by claiming “I'm Irish. Racism is part of… \nmore Awesome opening and closing scenes with a pretty rad buddy cop tale jammed in between. How are the McDonagh Brothers both SO good at endings? John Michael absolutely nails it here with the bite, the grit, the comedy, and the pathos. I love these Irish smartasses so much. Here's to hoping they both get back to making movies about sturdy pricks with guns. With the darkest of black comedy, characters with complex morals and a beautifully contemplative ending, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this is a Martin McDonagh film. And you wouldn't be far off, because it's from his brother John Michael McDonagh.\nWhile this didn't seem to have as much subtext underneath the surface as Martin's films, this was an absolute blast of a watch. One of the funniest films that I've seen from the 2010s, this is one hilariously written film, and I'm sure it's still got some level of subtext but I just couldn't really grasp what it was really about.\nBrendan Gleeson plays the wise-cracking \"unconventional\" village policeman perfectly, expertly firing off the abundant one-liners with an unmatched… \nmore A mismatched cop duo take on a gang of drug smugglers in Ireland. It has some funny moments but mostly it's not my kind of humour. What a beaut of a film, such a nice surprise. A hilarious crime comedy with a stellar cast, fun characters and even a bit touching at the end. Loved it :D Here we have a very underrated comedy/crime dark comedy with hints of unapologetic racism and even some anti-Americana flavor. The 'underrated' current state of \nThe Guard\n can be probably attributed to its misleading publicity with the same intensity that \nThe American\n (2010) received, but there is something you must keep in mind: it was directed by John Michael McDonagh, brother of Martin McDonagh, who brought us \nIn Bruges\n (2008).\nSelling itself as an R-rated comedy, but not in the way that you think, this stylish and moderate brief ride - which should and could have been longer - borrows the cop buddy formula of the 80s (that is, teaming two confrontational leading roles as cops in order to work for… \nmore",

Arizona and hearing the horrible events that took place there, I can honestly say it punches you right in the gut. To see the attack unfold in this movie is really something. Once it begins, this movie is as gripping as anything. \nI also liked that the Japanese were given half the movie to tell it from their own perspective.

    "Text": "A posse discovers a trio of men they suspect of murder and cow theft and are split between handing them over to the law or lynching them on the spot.\n95\nClocking in at a mere 75 minutes, William A. Wellman's \nThe Ox-Bow Incident\n is an expansive cinema of faces and moral quandaries but still bound in miniature. Its modest, studio-set look is merely the basis for an expressionistic work regarding mob mentality and the tirades against lawful discourse. With a stacked cast of developed, three-dimensional characters, this 'noir' western in style and principle unveils horrifying traits of human nature under the glow of moonlight. What stands out immediately is Wellman's expert knowledge of when to cut and when to simply move the camera in scenes involving a crowd. It makes a film that could've been stage-bound or lacking in energy deeply involving. Moving from one startling composition to another, and documenting various reactions from character to character. So very artful and efficient. One of Clint Eastwood's favorite films, and you can see why. Not one moment is out of place. So tightly controlled, but nonetheless a thoughtful vision. “The Ox-Bow Incident” is a courtroom drama that unfolds in the dark — beneath a long-limbed tree -with a bored mob of emasculated men playing at the roles of judge, jury and executioner. \nDirector William A. Wellman’s 75-minute masterpiece of a spirit-sucking barn burner dismantles the fiction of frontier justice. \nDepicting the forming of a lynch mob that chases down an alleged cattle wrangling murder, “Incident” shows the grave results when institutions fail individuals, and when individuals fail their better moral standards. In the pitch black of “Incident’s” perpetual night, there are no white hats - only dark and obscured faces. \nWellman’s work is, on its surface, an anti-lynching film. More complexly, it is also a condemnation of how idle… \nmore Could see how some might find its dark and harrowing depiction of mob justice a tad lecture-y in concept but in execution it's truly something else. The didactic speechifying and dignified calls for righteousness are kept to a minimum so that most of its runtime can be spent developing a mood of grim anticipation. The imagery is intensely fatalistic (those nooses hanging in the background!) and the characters drawn with a complex range of emotion and opinion about the dreadful act of violence they can feel themselves being swept up in as we tag along with their posse and witness their collective organizing overpowered by faulty information, clashing personality and a palpably hostile air of impatience and anger essentially in… \nmore",

Accompanied by his son’s wife he uncovers a trail of cover-ups that implicate the US State department which supports the dictatorship.\nobsessed with the fact that the us state department released a three page statement denouncing this film. that’s worth more than any silly little award The most conventional aspect of Missing is that Ed and Beth are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, and a number of their scenes together are him trying to reckon with her “kooky leftist views” that spit in the face of his conservative Christian Science. That Missing is helmed by one star from Old Hollywood (Lemmon) and one star from New Hollywood (Spacek) lends it an interesting air of legitimacy, so to speak. It’s not only that the horrible events of the film are happening, but they are happening to beloved Americans! The indignity! The injustice! The film goes so far to say as much just that near its conclusion, in which one of the sniveling U.S. diplomats says something to the effect that Lemmon’s Ed would not even care what the United States is doing in another country were he not personally involved.\nmore in fran magazine “they are killing people here, and nobody knows who’s next.”\nReally intense on multiple levels. At first we’re thrown into the dread of not knowing what’s happening or who to trust, the world has already collapsed into chaos. The film makes you feel the shock of sudden powerlessness, as scattered attacks erupt from a repressive, murderous regime. But the terror goes deeper than soldiers in the streets – it’s the realization that the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of the lawless. That order can be overturned overnight, leaving nothing to hold on to. And that there is no shelter. Even the people you believed were always on your side are the ones helping to cover it… \nmore",

His relentless search to find the terrorists leads to a cat-and-mouse conflict with a British government official whose own past may hold the clues to the identities of the elusive killers.\nUnflashy but very sturdy procedural thriller into which someone ingeniously dropped a Jackie Chan revenge movie. Campbell is still one of the best action guys of the last few decades, too; the fights here are quick, clear, and brutal. Killer Cliff Martinez score is the cherry on top. “The Foreigner” is a twisty political thriller about an deputy minister (Pierce Brosnan) who’s plotting to pardon some imprisoned IRA fighters without reigniting the Troubles. “The Foreigner” is also a revenge saga in which Jackie Chan plays a Vietnamese (?) explosives expert who’s obsessively determined to identify and eliminate the bombers who blew up his teenage daughter. Believe it or not, those two narratives don’t really complement one another all that well.

One of an elite group of assassins, Bishop may be the best in the business - with a unique talent for cleanly eliminating targets. When Harry McKenna, his close friend and mentor, is murdered, Harry’s son comes to him with vengeance in his heart and a desire to learn Bishop’s trade, signaling the birth of a deadly partnership.\nA gritty assassin movie with \nJason Stathom\n doing typical \nJason Stathom\n things. His dynamics with \nBen Foster\n were witty and enjoyable. It offers some stylishly cool action stretches with a solid finale, however the formulaic storyline and predictable narrative hurt the flow. It is good serviceable fun yet easily forgettable too. I have a feeling my love for Jason Statham is gonna have me watching a lot of average movies.

I don’t even remember writing this movie but I must’ve.😭\nStandard Statham flick but there’s sex scenes and now I want Jason Statham to give me Hitman lessons.🔫😎 It’s a fun movie. Güzel ama çok daha güzel filmleri de var... Jason Statham'ın izlediğim tüm filmleri içinde alt sıralarda kalan bir film benim için..... Klasik aksiyon dövüş sahneleri azdı.... 👍 Starring: The Bold, Bald, Gruff Action Man Jason Statham\nJason Statham finds another (short-lived?) franchise where his strength, gruffness, and badass attitude come in handy.\nThe story is interesting, and the predicament in which the protagonist finds himself, in which he must protect the son of the friend he has just killed, is where the tension is at its most. In this regard, the film makes use of this, though never to its full extent. Statham, as always, does a great job of delivering and selling on the action, particularly by revealing some humanity in a man who is, in many respects, a killing machine. Ben Foster, as usual, delivers a great performance that serves as the film's dramatic focal point. The action scenes themselves are decent, but they don't stand out.\nAll in all, a good action drama with some very good performances and interesting world building.\nTODAY SCHEDULE\nThe Mechanic\nMechanic: Resurrection\nHot Fuzz\nAt World's End he's not really a mechanic 100-word review: \nThe Mechanic\n serves up classic Jason Statham fare: gritty action, and his signature portrayal of an ultra-competent antihero. The movie delivers on its promise of adrenaline, but of course it falls into the trap of predictability that often characterises Statham's films. While it's undeniably fun, the plot follows a familiar formula, leaving little room for surprises. One notable drawback is the frenetic editing. With an excessive number of cuts, the film sacrifices visual coherence, making it challenging to fully appreciate the choreography and impact of the stunts. This editing style detracts from what could have been more immersive and memorable action sequences. The final fifteen minutes or so of the movie are so deep cheese that it partially redeems the rest of it. It felt like if they got Homer Simpson to direct a movie and he's sitting there watching the explosions and such thinking he nailed it and the executives are like what was that. Otherwise it felt like the pilot episode of an Amazon Original Series. Or I guess a reboot of the movie Arthur except he's also a hitman. I mean, it's basically just the same as every other Jason Statham action movie, but this one has Ben Foster in it Jason Statham looks nothing like a David and especially nothing like a Brad.\nArthur Bishop? Absolutely. And Ben Foster looks like a Steve because he's absolutely great and I just want him to be associated with my name.\nTo be honest, there's not much to comment on here aside from Foster. I only watched this because I suspect that the only thing that I might be able to catch at the cinema in the first week after the kids go back to school will be the sequel to this. So I thought I should prepare just in case. And it's not especially good, really, and I think I might stay home and see what's on TCM instead.\nThe first 40… \nmore Keeping this as high as 3☆ solely for the assassinations, which are legitimately cool.\nThe plot, pacing, and camerawork are all iffy. a better cinematic adaptation of the Hitman video game series than either actual movie we got from that source — forgot how brutal this is, with some of the best fights and kills of Statham’s career, and that garbage disposal gag is an all timer",

Partying ensues, and Mandy’s close pal, Emmet, keeps a watchful eye on the young males making a play for Mandy. Then two of the students are murdered.\nthis is a perfect example of a movie being smarter than its audience bc half the reviews here are like “why did everyone love Mandy? she’s so boring” when that’s literally the entire point of the movie…like we learn nothing about Mandy because none of the characters \nactually\n know anything about her, they’re all just projecting onto her. it’s literally a slasher movie about the dangers of the male gaze. duh. i watched this like ten years ago and barely remembered anything so rewatching it felt kinda like seeing it for the first time and honestly it's still great and i think this movie is criminally underrated. Like no, it’s not groundbreaking or anything, but amber heard as mandy lane is so charismatic. Mandy is so mysterious, so cool, all the boys are obsessed with her for no reason, they all wanna fuck her and i don’t know i just love that. She’s cold, distant, almost unreadable, and the movie pretty much shows why obsession like that never leads to anything good\nit’s got that perfect 2000s teen horror vibe too with a group of teens in a house in the middle of nowhere, people start dying, no one’s acting normal... SO FUN!! I don’t know i just think it’s a good little slasher. Not reinventing the genre but definitely giving something. Y’all should give it a try! mandy lane is a lesbian and a girlboss",

It accounts Hungarian Communists generally supporting the 'Red' revolutionaries in conflict with the 'White' counter-revolutionaries for control of the region. There's some magnificent cinematography from Tamás Somló which is impressive equally on both a visual and technical breadth, and the camera chiefly classifies the characters crusades for superiority as an endless rotation of increase and loss.\nIt delivers a vast amount of elegiac and stylistic virtuosity… \nmore One of the few truly anti-war pictures. \nJancso's masterful direction keeps you enthralled.\nThe Red and the White paints war as utter chaos.It is a nihilistic, bleak and violent picture. \nThe movie is very political driven to show that war is meaningless and can sometimes be confusing to see which side is really the “good” guy and which is not. The movie demonstrates this characteristic by being confusing for the viewer to follow.

At its heart is Ali's magnetic charisma, which shines through as he prepares for the iconic boxing match. The film portrays Foreman in an unfair role as the villain, juxtaposing his formidable presence against Ali's poetic bravado.

Tones constantly shifting, paces suddenly progressing & regressing, sporadic back-and-forths between smooth contemplation and immeasurable (& indeed psychologically irritating, but… \nmore charges that this is reductive and possibly narcissistic aren't necessarily unfounded, but Hopper conversely refuses to exclude himself from his own anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist rant. even if these are some easy targets he acknowledges that he's complicit in the insidious mythology that allows them to flourish.",

Zhao Tao has never been better, and... well, I was wondering who Sylvia Chang would play in this film, and it's safe to say i was not expecting THAT. yeah, the third part is... well, it's a gamble, but all's well that ends well. GO WEST. Nothing new to add here yet other than my now crushed emotional status - but I'll just add-up here what I wrote for Sean Gilman back in October when it played a few nights in Vancouver.\n---\nThe most ambitious film so far from the great director Jia Zhangke, working in a gorgeous, cyclical structure that it might make it too easy to disregard the film’s more provocative aspects. Jia has been obsessed with the globalization of China since day one, but what is different here is the syphoning of aspects of contemporary China into three broken segments, each of which purport to be a narrative-driven family melodrama. But what seems youthful naivete is rather the fading of a culture,… \nmore Finally caught up with this. Was on a jury with Jia so it was a little embarrassing that I hadn't seen his last two films... this one and Ash is Purest White. Waiting for the US theatrical release of Ash so I can see on big screen. \nThis might be my least fave of his. Still compelling but the 2025 section wasn't entirely working for me. Perhaps it was the jump to English. \nKino Lorber Blu-ray",

Es un documental repleto de grises que no omite polémicas personales, pero que principalmente humaniza su figura y ayuda a entender su magnitud y sus pros y contras sin juzgamientos ni bajada… \nmore What does it mean to be a god? Or to be treated as one? \nDiego Maradona\n is a documentary that transcends a simple biographical retelling. It's a true story the best dramatist couldn't produce. It's a tale of addiction, of the power of football, of a man placed on a pedestal so few deserve. The genius of \nDiego Maradona\n is that it covers just the part of his life set in Naples but it uses that to represent a microcosm of Maradona's whole life, bookended by montages that show us his life pre-Naples and post-Naples. It's a compelling examination, contextualising moments so perfectly as it stays focused on Naples but flickers out to other things that matter. If you like… \nmore I'm not sure this is an effective portrait of a guy who succumbed to the pressures of fame; it mostly just seems like he succumbed to his tremendous ego. But it's definitely an effective portrait of a culture that was all too eager to enable that tremendous ego for its own purposes and then dispose of the man when, for whatever reason, he burnt out.",

The rhythm of the line deliveries in every scene is almost magical. Too many examples to choose from—seriously, I could literally pick any moment—but there's an interaction in the final 15 minutes where something the audience already knows is revealed to everyone else in the courtroom and it still manages to come off just as shocking to us as it does to those in the film. That moment works because the nanoseconds in between every word in this thing feel carefully planned and completely intentional. A brief stutter speaks volumes at one point. This attention to detail reels you in and makes it the shortest two hours and forty minutes you'll ever sit through. I'll say it again: hypnotic. \nBut hey that's just one of many things I love about this film. Fantastic all around. A lawyer who really likes to fish on the side feels like the character Jimmy Stewart was born to play! to me, there are fewer things more surreal than hearing someone say the word \"bitch\" in a Hollywood film from 1959 I liked the part where Jimmy Stewart requested for the victim's dog to be in the courtroom.",

That was cool. Lots of little details and parts of it that would be super fun to analyze some day as well. I will say that while I enjoyed the ending, I feel like I was supposed to be crying my eyes out and I was really kinda so far from doing so. Also Carey Mulligan’s character transformed a little too sudden for believability. But overall, great film, will definitely be recommending to my mom. Families are built upon two things: blood and belief. They can get by on the strength of one or the other (to have both is something of a luxury), but when the latter starts to wither, the former can only do so much to save it.

This mid 90's Argento offering begins with one of my favorite openings in Dario’s filmography before claustrophobically weaving a macabre mystery littered with scenes of unsettling psychological explorations into trauma and identity that still manages to leave me gobsmacked at conclusion. \nDespite the constant yawnworthy old hat chatter about Argento’s offerings after \nOpera\n being shitstorms of mediocrity or worse, \nThe Stendhal Syndrome\n has grown to become one of my favorite Argento murder jams, albeit one I don’t revisit as frequently as say, \nTenebre\n (I think I watched that five times this year lol),… \nmore For those who don’t know, the Stendhal Syndrome is a psychosomatic disorder that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing art. Its effects on sufferers are serious enough for them to require hospitalization. \n“Argento has stated that he experienced Stendhal Syndrome as a child—while touring Athens with his parents, young Dario was climbing the steps of the Parthenon when he was overcome by a trance that caused him to become lost from his parents for hours. The experience was so strong that Argento never forgot it; he immediately thought of it when he came across Graziella Magherini's book about the syndrome, which would become the basis of the film.”\nI appreciate this more everytime I watch it and can’t wait to get my hands on the new Blue Underground disc.

Em outras palavras: Hitchcock filma o feérico, o absurdo, extrapola ao máximo o pressuposto realista das situações que filma, mas nos seus filmes o absurdo \nsempre\n é composto da forma mais racional e lógica, sempre é definido e instalado sobre um fundo impecavelmente construído que a construção fílmica não faz mais que impregnar de… \nmore",

Jim Hosking has such a unique vision and even when jokes or ideas may not completely work, you can't help but admire the audacity and outrageousness of his choices. It's going to be very interesting to see where his career goes (Hopefully the way of Lynch).\nAubrey Plaza's performance (one of her strongest), along with an effective score by Andrew Hung makes for a very moving scene about 3/4 through the film.\nI wish I was able to see more films at Beyond Fest this year. They have such a great line-up. Aubrey Plaza: *does anything*\nMe: HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Have you ever watched a Wes Anderson film and though to yourself, \"Man, I wish this was more eccentric and strange.\" \nThis is that movie.\nEnjoy.",

Growing privations, combined with increasing social and religious persecution, motivate the Nilssons and many of their neighbors to strike out for the United States. Following a treacherous ocean crossing and an equally grueling land passage, the emigrants find themselves in seemingly idyllic Minnesota.\nFirst time watch for me. Truly engaging epic saga that takes its time and focuses on the minutia. Eye-opening look at the class inequalities that led to immigration in mid-nineteenth century Sweden. Director Jan Troell's directing (sometimes employing docu style) seems far ahead its time. And he writes, directs, edits and shoots... incredibly impressive. \nFrom imdb trivia: The first movie to be nominated for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and not win either award.\nCriterion released a boxset that includes Jan Troell's follow-up The New Land, which I'm looking forward to watching asap. \n- New high-definition digital restorations of both films, with uncompressed monaural soundtracks on the Blu-rays\n- New introduction by theater and… \nmore Jan Troell’s “The Emigrants” is a journey to the New World carried by the winds of necessity, rather than promise.\nTroell’s three-hour epic is the first of two films following a group of late 19th century agrarian Swedes as they depart their impoverished native land for a new life in Minnesota. \nBut while they are borne across the ocean on a precariously small vessel - Troell never lets his subjects, or the viewer, free from the excessive and burdensome baggage of home. It is lugged - creaking, from weight - on boats, trains, river steamers — finally to be deposited at its destination. A ‘new’ life. \nTroell’s style of direction in “Emigrants” is strikingly modern in its movement and tangibility.… \nmore i love the swedish title of this, UTVANDRARNA, it's such a daunting and massive word to look at and pronounce. as was the process of getting myself ready to watch this for the first time; huge but tiny, epic but glacially so. 200 minutes of intimacy, pain, desire, hope, illusion, history. \na largely lost film in the context of future american cinematic cultural landscapes, but the 'highbrow rich' of the early 70s ('sophisticated' academy voters) enjoyed patting themselves on their back when awarding and highlighting this movie. its completely methodical and frankly simple approach to classical narrative storytelling \nis\n secretly broadly appealing, it just moves so, so gradually and with little fierce three-act-structure communication, so i assume american industry members… \nmore",

It's very clear that the goal here is to capture how thoroughly dispiriting environmental activism can feel. Whether that's a politically useful lens in which to view the subject is one thing but personally, I found by hyper-focusing on the alienation of everyday complicity vs. the logistical flaws of resistance Reichardt dramatically captures the soul-crushing genius of this system which is that it is so overwhelmingly large it makes both joining it and resisting it an act of individual moral compromising. Bleak stuff. I jotted down some notes about this movie while at work, so I figured I might as well transcribe them here:\nThis is a bleak movie. A muted, narrow terrorist thriller. It contains exactly two acts of violence, both represented obliquely. But the anticipation of or fallout from these acts permeates every remaining second. These are three characters who are going to \ndo something\n—who, before long, have \ndone something\n, the end result of meticulous planning. That fact about them informs their behavior, strains their relationships, controls their lives.\nOn its surface, this is a story about activism; it immerses itself in the question of how to change the world for the better. But you'd never mistake it for agitprop or… \nmore This movie is basically divided in two by a crucial event at its midpoint; I'd rate the first half a masterpiece of procedural suspense, and the second half a solid good, so we'll call it a 4-star movie overall. My big beef with the latter part is Eisenberg; he makes a one-character piece a bit too one-note. Eisenberg can play a marvelous motormouth; here he's cast as brooding loner, and not a particularly convincing one; I found his coiled spring of paranoia and anger surprisingly flat. Some of the early scenes, though, are as good as they come. The way Kelly Reichardt conveys information with a glance or a lingering shot is just incredible. Plus, all the HOT FERTILIZER PURCHASING ACTION (which is actually the best sequence in the film).",

Desperate to capture the elusive outlaw, Hoover makes Dillinger his first Public Enemy Number One and assigns his top agent, Melvin Purvis, the task of bringing him in dead or alive.\n\"Pretty boy Floyd, you're under arrest.\"\n\"It's Charles... Charles Floyd.\"\nMann is one of the few filmmakers that understands how inherently dehumanizing institutions are (\nBlackhat\n his most thrillingly literal translation of the idea); here we see American history, often experienced from a distance, made into a deeply intimate, human portrait of obsolescence—the immediacy of the 'cops and robbers' foreground (gunfire has never been as palpable) a distraction from the real crimes, the real war happening just outside the frame. The mythic, romanticized feud between American icons Dillinger and Pervis is rendered here as a brutal tragedy, both are too single-minded in their missions to see that they're cogs in the rise of cruel American systems (surveillance, banks, telecommunications, the FBI,… \nmore Follows Dillinger repeatedly from right behind, that trademark Mann shoulder close-up.

The last time that follow shot happens is a snap before a bullet blows through his cheek, and suddenly he stops short, turns around, and sees it coming. I saw recently on here a write-up noting that this film quite literally sits between Miami Vice's stylistic motivations and Blackhat's political ones - I think that's true, but on a bigger, more extreme scale than either film ever reaches. \nPublic Enemies\n is an enormous film and in my opinion arguably Mann's richest, constantly shifting & intertwining thematic outliers and formal conceits - it's yet another film about Baudrilliardian prison simulacra, but also a film on the birth of modern surveillance & the FBI, the birth of modern celebrity, a character study of Dillinger himself, the end of a certain romanticism & how all these points shaped the America which we know today.

I am watching him in \nBoardwalk Empire\n right now and I'm practically getting whiplash ova here! Mir war bis kurz vor Schluss nicht klar, ob „Jolt“ eine Parodie auf Filme wie „Crank“ und „Atomic Blonde“ sein sollte oder ob den Quatsch tatsächlich irgendjemand so richtig ernst gemeint hat. Das Tempo, die Geschichte, die Prämisse - alles ist hier so absurd überdreht, dass es schlicht lachhaft wirkt. Und doch…das kann doch nur Absicht gewesen sein. Oder?!\nDie Dialoge zB bestehen ausschließlich aus Phrasen und coolen Pickup-Lines, die so kein echtes Lebewesen jemals aussprechen würde. Richtig unangenehm ist auch die Liaison zwischen Beckinsale und Jai Courtney, die zusammen ungefähr so viel Anziehungskraft ausstrahlen wie zwei gleichnamige Magnetpole. Alles was hier auch nur entfernt mit menschlichen Reaktionen oder Emotionen zu tun hat, wirkt so fake wie Kate Beckinsales Perücke oder ihre fleißig… \nmore",

There’s too much contemporary American western flavor here for my tastes and I think that bogs this thing down—Imagine a world where one of the Sergios made this.\nNitpicks aside, this is a solid western revenge jam, albeit with a bit too much filler for my tastes, but Ted Post does a decent job and this ended up being a nice cap off to my weekend—plus the title and poster are damn great.

That’s probably why I don’t remember much about it from back then. Ahh, it’s all starting to make sense now, isn’t it?\nPerhaps the reason for that is because it is really quite procedural. It’s very different from the Eastwood westerns around that time, with a lot less shooting and general violence.

Whether there's nine men out in the plains with a dirty rope or a judge with his robe on in front of the American flag.

And if you can't see the difference, you'd better take off that star right now.”\nAfter completing the Dollars trilogy this was the next Western that Clint Eastwood starred in.\nA band of vigilantes catch Jed Cooper (Eastwood) and wrongly believing him guilty of cattle rustling and murder, hang him, and leave… \nmore",

This thriller builds its own suspense, making itself just the right amount of chaotic while still being easy to watch for me.\nAnd the mystery keeps growing all the time. The coastal setting of the film creates a sense of sweaty tension, and the rhythmic music with its instruments and steady buildup… \nmore Totally watchable, even if it all hinges on a police department comprised only of the dumbest cops on Earth. Anyway it's easy to forget just how well Denzel plays cornered and desperate, and how effectively he deploys his patented swagger to complement that. Here he's sort of at a Lagrange point between Alonzo Harris and Whip Whitaker. Carl Franklin makes it look pretty easy.\nThis also had a \nlot\n of really amusingly obvious product placement. Tons of scenes open with a shot of something-or-other, like a beer bottle, or there's a part where all the cops are having a Domino's pizza lunch-break, one of them conveniently tilting the box toward the camera. My favorite was Denzel stomping on a guy's phone and repeatedly shouting, \"Can you hear me now?\"",

With rebels and the army struggling for control, French peacekeeping forces move out, warning the remaining white residents that they’re on their own. But Maria refuses to be driven off the land, even as tragedy looms.\nThis is as blunt a film as Claire Denis ever made. With an almost derisive air, she exposes the madness of white appropriation, of colonialism and its lingering effects, and of the poisonous nature of violence. It's not that she hates her protagonist, with her naivete and hubris, but that she acknowledges those flaws in a manner that understands where they will lead. \nNo matter how much Maria believes she is of Africa, or that her son is of Africa, she will always be an outsider because of the cultural, historical, and racial issues that exist between her and the locals. Even her friendships with the Africans (there's never a distinction of what part of the continent the film is… \nmore My introduction to the work of Claire Denis, \nWhite Material\n, is a commanding portrait of a woman ardently, stubbornly rooted in a land that rejects her foreignness. Isabelle Huppert stars as Maria Vial, the manager of an insolvent coffee plantation in an unspecified African nation on the precipice of civil war in the early days of decolonization. Her struggles are manifold and range from labor disputes and domestic tensions to professional treachery and identity crisis, all coalescing on the backdrop of civil unrest and mortal danger that seeps incrementally closer to her home.\nWithout sacrificing too much of the plot, I’ll say that Isabelle Huppert’s Maria is as complex as her predicament. She is curious and childlike one moment, a… \nmore The image of Scarlet O'Hara burns in Maria Vial, two women bound by stubbornness, civil war, colonial white privilege, and a fierce dedication for indigenous land. Land is the key element here. Being rooted in land, and exploiting it economically, is the foundation of colonialism. \nIn this near mythic retelling of post-colonial rule in Africa, anarchy has taken over and convulsed the land, raped and pillaged it, leading white armies and black rebels to embrace civil war in all its ugly, destructive grandeur. \nAt the center of all this looting, burning, fleeing, and savagery, Maria Vial tries to make sense of the chaos, totally ignorant of her complicit role in it. \"It's people like you who make this country corrupt,\"… \nmore",

The only reason he curses prince Manuwalde is because he is black. He is a brilliant wordsmith though. I mean, Blacula, it's brilliant. The fact that nobody calls him that in the rest of the film is a bit of a bummer for him though.\n-Black vampires apparently don't only grow fangs, they also grow sideburns.\n-A vampire chasing a woman set to a Theme from Shaft-esque song is refreshingly odd.\n- Apparently it's completely normal to have a rather long song and dance routine in the middle of the film.\n- Those opening credits.

For instance, there is a scene here where The Tramp is waiting in line for a job. He keeps trying to make his way to the counter where the jobs are dispensed. Again and again, the burlier men muscle him out of the way, ultimately leaving him jobless and hungry. In the next scene, we see Scraps the dog being viciously attacked by a pack of mongrels. Chaplin is saying that the life of disadvantaged humans is not fundamentally different from the life of a dog. Both are subject to the whims of those more powerful than themselves, both desire amiable companionship, and both all too often go hungry. It is a lovely little film, arguably Chaplin's first masterpiece. \"When dreams come true.\"\nCharlie Chaplin is the only filmmaker I know capable of motivating me to actively seek out movies which are older now than I may ever live to become. Something about the little details he gives all his characters, like when the Tramp surreptitiously steals a sausage and then goes back for a bit of dipping sauce. Something about the way he understands humanity and grounds his comedy in a deep sympathy created from fundamentally relatable conflicts like finding something to eat and getting a job and falling in love.

In which a trashy erotic thriller plot involving a misogynistic serial killer who gruesomely \"disarticulates\" his victims (and leaves their body parts in various locations around NYC) is relegated to the periphery of a sad and confusing drama about a lonely English teacher and all the men in her life (a dotting younger student obsessed with John Wayne Gacy, an eccentric ex who is stalking her, an attractive detective who could very well be the killer in question), and drawn in such a stylistically fractured, blurred, and discolored fashion that when the pulpy genre elements come back into play they feel even ickier and more contradictory. Which is an impressively deliberate tightrope walk Campion performs, as they're… \nmore",

In all seriousness, I am baffled that this film is getting blasted by the critics.\nChappie\n is actually a pretty deep movie.

Mr. Blomkamp makes nice looking movies, and Mr. Copley is Mr. Blomkamp's muse. Plus, the camera doesn't shake like a Polaroid picture in Chappie. So, you can leave your headache medicine at home.

I was so inspired by that and \nBoyhood\n is one of the driving forces to push me to make films. \nTonight I got to meet Richard Linklater and it was visceral. I was shaking when I went up to him, took a photo with him, and shook his hand. I have been feeling very down as of late and this lifted my spirits.

Whereas \nThe Last Detail\n was about buying time, \nLast Flag Flying\n is a reflection on what we have left, who we choose to spend it with, and what ends up mattering. That Linklater uses such a spiritual sequel angle to ruminate on the specifics of governmental lies ends up affecting typical moments of patriotism and pride, with a final coda being uncommonly heavy in an ambiguous way. Steve Carell is the standout, far and away, although all three actors are parading through Linklater and Ponicsan's screenplay in the most… \nmore My memory of THE LAST DETAIL is pretty thin, so I have no idea how this does or doesn't line up. As Linklater hangouts go I was surprised to find this one fueled mostly by guilt, simmering resentment, and anger.

This impressionistic retelling of the Greek legend of Orpheus and Eurydice introduced bossa nova to the world with its soundtrack by young Brazilian composers Luiz Bonfá and Antonio Carlos Jobim.\nOrpheus and Eurydice\n: \n*die*\nThe children: 🕺🕺🕺 As a Brazilian, I must say it took me quite a while to recognize my own country and people under Camus' foreign, exoticized gaze. This mythical romance is best viewed as a musical of sorts, unless one's unwilling to suspend disbelief, actually believing poor Brazilians dance all the time, Carnival time or not. Among the grievances, the numerous samba sequences that are absurdly long, the soundtrack which often veers into the realm of cacophony, and the acting, which is mostly unconvincing. It gets better as it becomes darker, more tragic and more ethereal, though it takes its sweet time getting there. Overall, for a Palme d'Or and Oscar winner, it leaves a lot to be desired. About 10 years after Cocteau’s masterful modern telling of this ancient myth comes another more radical retelling from a French director.\nI’m glad this movie was shot in color. The majority of foreign films at the time were in black and white and the colors of Brazil and the Carnival enhance the mystery of the myth. Additionally, the backdrop of carnival allows for exaggerated costumes without detracting from realism. (Did Bond steal the death costume from this for the opening of Spectre?)\nOn the cusp of bossanova’s popularization in the US, it was fun to hear some early developments in the genre. I’m a huge fan of Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim as well as Sergio Mendes who drifts… \nmore",

When the populace is caught in the midst of a gang war that he caused, Castle must again emerge from the shadows and save the innocent. ×\nFrank Castle lives in a sewer lair like a Ninja Turtle, fights scuba ninjas (also like a Ninja Turtle), mumbles like Dolph Lundgren, battles the Yakuza in an old timey amusement park (where dozens of bad guys simultaneously ride one of those big slides \nwhile firing machine guns\n), and in one scene after Frank blows up a mobster's house a journalist screams “Holy shit, it’s the Punisher!”\nWhat I’m saying is, I think this is the best movie about the Punisher? Forget PUNISHER: WAR ZONE. Goldblatt made an 80s action masterpiece.\n10 reasons why you should stop everything and watch THE PUNISHER now:\n1. Dolph Lundgren (!) as Frank Castle / The Punisher.\n2.

Consider me punished for watching this. one of the best comic book movies because it refuses to let the audience feel like they're in a fantasy - aside from the stark aesthetic and bizarre premise, it barely seems like a comic - even when the punisher is riding a motorcycle through the sewers or coney island, the dark and fog and angst make it feel brutal instead of goofy. the yakuza is stylish but utterly deranged, louis gossett jr gives a sad & broken performance that deserves a less ridiculous movie, the comic relief is a washed up alcoholic, dolph lundgren looks close to death even when he's delivering his perversely funny one-liners. it's undeniably fun to watch, and imo a movie this violent yet enjoyable should… \nmore still the best Marvel movie Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher might have been a wet dream for Marvel and action fans alike in '89, but it was released on the same year and with a much smaller budget than Keaton's Batman. So it was largely overshadowed by the first major theatrical release of the Caped Crusader as many folks in '89 were raving about both Keaton and Nicholson's performances in the slightly campier and slightly less violent DC flick (yes, in Batman a person does get roasted alive in one of the coolest comic book scenes ever in film, but the amount of bullets flying here and the explosions and violence against kids has me considering this feature as without a doubt more violent). As… \nmore A decent comic book film, with enjoyable fight scenes and explosions. But when you compare Dolph Lungren’s performance to Jon Bernthal’s embodiment of the character, it falls short greatly. The plot is what you expect with the Punisher.",

George Romero’s widow stated that she believes that it was shelved because the organization that hired him to make a movie about elder abuse was just to edgy for their tastes.

The title then carries with it a sense of foredestined fatalism in which one false move, many false moves, occurs constantly both obvious and not which steers its players towards a crossing of roads that arrives sooner than they expect.

It's bizarre, disturbing, and amusing; it's a film that, in a rational world, would never exist, but here it is.\nAll in all, I'm not sure what more to say; if the cast and crew, as well as the premise of a disturbed guy who utilizes a spooky-looking puppet to offload his homicidal traumas, don't compel you to see this film, I'm not sure what will.\nTODAY SCHEDULE\nMagic\nNovitiate\nAgnes of God\nForgotten anthony hopkins wearing matching sweaters with fats was so cute and i will be very upset if sam raimi doesn't include this in his remake",

Legends James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart star as army buddies whose fortunes rise and fall as their fates intersect, first in a foxhole on the front lines of World War I, then in Manhattan’s Prohibition-era underworld. Directed by Hollywood master Raoul Walsh, and based on a story by prolific journalist turned screenwriter and producer Mark Hellinger, The Roaring Twenties brought to a close the celebrated Warner Bros. gangster cycle of the 1930s, and it remains one of the greatest and most influential crime films of all time.\nOur edition arrives on February 27, 2024. To learn more or pre-order, visit \n Criterion.com. Arriving at tail-end of the trend of prohibition-era gangster films and intended as something of a goodbye Walsh applies a sophisticated, freewheeling energy composed of kinetic camera moves, elaborate montages and bursts of ruthless violence to tackle the entire decade—from WWI to the great depression to FDR and the end of prohibition. and in the process he essentially invents the Scorsese model of tracing the crime underworld through the passage of time, minute gang politics and the hangout, low-level POV of those who find themselves spending their lifetime in its historical orbit. Just the best! Bogart had appeared in a number of the Warner gangster films as a side character by this point but this is the one to finally… \nmore He used to be a big shot.\n-Panama Smith\nThe film can probably best be described as a fast paced gangster epic. The story is truly epic in scope as it starts out in World War I and makes it's way to the early 30s covering everything from prohibition, the stock market crash and the great depression. This would be the last film \nJames Cagney\n and \nHumphrey Bogart\n made together.\nThis would also mark the last gangster film \nCagney\n would star in before swearing off the genre. He would actually go a decade before returning to it in the legendary \nWhite Heat\n, coincidentally by the same director: \nRaoul Walsh\n. The gangster genre was winding down to make way for film-noir,… \nmore",

Took my dad (who had never before seen a Jackie Chan film) to see this at the Princess Cinema, an art house in Waterloo, Ontario.\nThink of how difficult it would be to do a single backflip. Now imagine, like, 15 uninterrupted minutes of incredible feats of physical agility. I actually think it's possible to underrate the fight scenes in this movie because they are so dense with \nstuff\n that the human eye and brain can barely take it all in. A few thoughts:\n1. This film rips cultural appropriation, colonialism, and the British in general a new asshole. It makes direct reference to it in the plot and with some exposition, but it drives the point home by making the villains as sneeringly \"British\" as possible. I'm sure it rankles a few colonial feathers, but whatever. That's what you get for conquering, enslaving, and generally being jerks to the entire world. \n2. The final fight sequence lasts something like three years, but it's entirely worth it. Jackie Chan's physical performance is a wonder.

I'm absolutely here for it. Aristocratic verbal slapfights. Artful social engineering. Lush visual presentation. Layer upon layer of subtle story telling (there is even a side-plot murder mystery embedded within). \nIf you watch this movie without paying attention, it may seem like a cluster of high society ponces desperately trying to out ponce each other. But it has much more going on. Every interaction represents a risky social maneuver for someone. Sometimes boldly announcing their intentions, other times hopping to sell a lie. At all times hoping to gain advantage or ameliorate wounded reputation.\nAnd it's all done from within the rigid confines of the aristocratic social code. From behind exaggerated period costumes. Within the idyllic walls of a country estate. People behaving like statues, statues behaving like people. \nA detail rich film that rewards multiple viewings. One of the best films I have seen in a while. “You sound as impotent by day as you perform by night.”\nPeter Greenaway’s first traditional narrative film \nThe Draughtsman’s Contract\n is a stylish and clever period drama, clearly drawing inspiration from \nBarry Lyndon \nin its regal 17/18th century imagery but with its own uniquely compelling characters and biting sense of humour. It’s biggest strength is in writing - heavy on dialogue but consistently entertaining with back and forth lines of intricately worded, archaic insults, and an elaborate story that’s as flowery and emphatic as the characters themselves; maybe sometimes being a little difficult to follow if you’re not paying full attention but fascinating nonetheless. I’m a fan of period movies in general even though they are kind of hit or miss, but this is one definitely done right; original, delightful, and surely having its own influence over films that succeeded it.",

All of this is made possible by a cinema in which aesthetics assume religious force, culture exists on a continuum, and art has a memory.\nIn other words, don’t be fooled that his latest feature is a hyper-faithful adaptation of a half-illustrated children’s novel by “The Invention of Hugo Cabret” author Brian Selznick — “Wonderstruck” is nothing if not a Todd Haynes movie. And it’s an exquisite one, at that.

That's a pretty funny understatement.\n52 project: 42/52 An absolutely toxic screwball that doesn't so much update the genre for a nihilistic and self-absorbed era as demonstrate that the genre had beaten society to that punch by a good 40 years. Matthau is a collection of faces housed in a shambling figure, a trickster god finally outsmarted after millennia of existence by his own profligacy. The montage of him morosely bidding farewell to the trappings of his life as he slowly drives around town in his collapsing Ferrari is just about as British as American class comedy can get, and Henry's transition into a Bluebeard/Verdoux grotesque only completes the black joke. At the other end is May herself, who manages to play both the leads in Bringing Up… \nmore \"Excuse me, you're not by any chance related to the Boston Hitlers?\" So funny. While this may be her directorial debut it feels like such a perfect bundle of everything I love about Elaine May. Hilarious, clever, a little sad, and different. So different. I'm not alone when I say for the hundredth time that May was way ahead of her time, but even if she was making movies today (which apparently she might be doing soon?) nobody could come close to replicating her work. Heavens! Feel like I’ve seen a million imitations of this movie but none that feel so chaotic and “unfinished” in it’s plotting. But I think I mean that in a good way? Matthau’s character is a sociopath, he has no comeuppance, Henrietta never learns of his scheme, and he makes a sudden about face at the end for reasons I don’t think I understand. It’s an odd couple pairing without a straight man. And it’s so funny. \"You have preserved in your own lifetime sir, a way of life that was dead before you were born.\". The perfect 70s counterpoint to 30's class screwball comedy. she’s so me (autistic and highly susceptible to falling in love in 3 days) He was a broke asexual sociopath, she was an immensely wealthy autistic bimbo, could I make it anymore obvious? Absolutely brilliant farce. How did I go this long before seeing it? Horrible rich guy goes bankrupt throwing his money around too frivolously, so he marries a rich social misfit to support his lifestyle, with plans to murder her for money down the line. And yet... this is a love story. Billy Wilder would be proud. \"Marriage is the only way to acquire property without labor.\"\nRich asshole Walter Matthau spends himself broke and plots to marry and murder a guileless, graceless botanist who is the heiress to a large fortune to maintain the quality of life he's become accustomed to. \nThis movie is extremely funny in a way that feels contemporary unlike most comedy of a similar era. Elaine May was trailblazing a style of American comedy writing that finds its heirs in The Simpsons and 30 Rock. Matthau is so fucking funny in this, just a perfect comic actor. The scene where some widower is about flop out her tits for him and he just yells \"No! Don't let them out!\" and runs away had me dying. Matthau owning a Ferrari in New York City is such an amazing character detail",

Separately, that throwaway line is vaguely applicable to the film itself. Whereas upcoming tentpoles like “Suicide Squad” and “Jason Bourne” will enjoy the momentum afforded to them by their respective franchises, “The Legend of Tarzan” — despite centering on an Edgar Rice Burroughs character who’s almost as old as movies themselves — could hardly have less going for it. Most $180 million movies have running starts, but this one is a 747 trying to take off with only 50 feet of runway.\nREAD THE FULL REVIEW ON INDIEWIRE In the film’s final setpiece, all of the Congo’s wild beasts rampage through a Belgian settlement while Tarzan makes a final push to save Jane from Rom. Something in this image of a foreign power invading this unspoiled land, stripping it of its natural resources, and leaving it a smoldering ruin, feels like a metaphor for the way Hollywood strip-mines famous brands for content. Even though \nThe Legend of Tarzan\n doesn’t directly continue any specific movie, it’s structured just like a legacyquel; it’s trying to find a way to make a very old concept feel new again. But some concepts resist modernization despite their creators’ best intentions. And sometimes the only way to make something truly new is to make something truly new.\nFull review at \nScreenCrush\n. not enough margot robbie Robbie and SLJ are the only actors who showed effort here.

There’s some god awful CG’s that are unacceptable, even in an early 90’s video game.  Now for the positives.  There were a couple of funny lines a few of which I’m sure weren’t intentionally meant to be and……….yep that’s it.

Which is a (powerful) reaction you don't get very often. And which is a reaction I loved having. (God, that's sounds weird.)\nI know most people thought it was a pretty good movie but didn't \nlove it as much as I did. I don't know... I guess I think this movie is so perfect because of its simplicity. After seeing \"Another Earth\" I think it's safe to say that I will watch anything with Brit Marling's name on it. \nThe whole movie was electric.… \nmore brit marling playing wii sports call it what it is: peak cinema This movie breathes. This movie is very much an artform. An amazing movie with a good plot which is executed nicely. The central theme of the movie revolves around Redemption rather than on the sci-fi counterpart. The sci-fi concept presented is fascinating in its own way as well. I feel some people mistakingly expect this to be a science-fiction movie. It's kinda philosophical if im nah mistaken y'all. It's about the human heart and spirit. I hope you find it as I have. \nBreathtaking.\nThis movie was very well written, superbly directed and expertly acted. The ending was incredible. \nBrit Marling\n is highly underrated American actor out there.\n\"You don't know what's out there.\"\n\"That's why I would go...\"\n\"Another me. Another you. Up there.\" I just want to know if the other earth has the OA season 3 and if so I want to go to there It is scientifically proved that everything Brit Marling touches turns into gold. that dude straight up played an axe\nedit: i just realised it was a saw “FORGIVE” \nNow THIS is how you do sci-fi. \nI’ve seen this at least 8 times, and it’s one of my \nfavorite films\n. \nThis Sundance award-winning gem expertly captures the feelings of guilt, grief, and in the end, redemption. \nA prime example of “less is more” filmmaking. \nAnother Earth\n cost only $100k to make. Similar Hollywood films cost HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS to make, and in my opinion they’re not nearly as good.\nBrit Marling stars and co-wrote the screenplay. I love her. She’s the genius behind \nThe OA\n (TV series), and I’ve enjoyed every film she’s been involved with. It co-stars William Mapother, Tom Cruise’s weird-looking cousin. \nTo me, the duplicate earth / sci-fi elements are secondary to the human story… \nmore There’s something about Brit Marling– and every project she’s ever attached to, that always leaves me with this lingering feeling that I cannot quite put into words. But I love it and I love her. Part of \nLow Budget Cinema\nAnother Earth is a fascinating movie because eliminating the science fiction element of the story changes almost nothing at the level of narrative. Rhoda could have won a trip to Wisconsin and most of what goes on would still make sense. But what does change is the emotional and thematic depth of what happens, and I think this is how it works best. What's great about it is that, like the best science fiction, it uses this fantastical addition in order to explore the protagonist's conflict in a way that wouldn't be possible otherwise.\nThe problem is that it doesn't seem to know where it wants to go in the final act and removes any… \nmore This was a weak attempt at mixing science fiction and drama. Both angles did not work for me and I felt both were underdeveloped. The drama of the car crash and Rhoda's relationship with the father who survived the crash was unoriginal and sappy. The science fiction aspect of a second earth right next to our own is an interesting idea, but the execution was lacking at best. Some shots of having the planet in the background worked well, but overall I could not take the science nor the drama seriously. Despite the weak script and plot I found Brit Marling, quite good and convincing. The wise old sage in the form of a blind Indian janitor was cringeworthy though. Someday maybe someone will love me as much as Brit Marling loves space So, this is my favourite film but I don't think I've properly gone into why I love it so much. Because of this, I decided to rewatch it tonight and try to do a good enough review that explains why this is such an amazing film. \nOn the eve of a discover of an Earth-like planet, Rhoda (Brit Marling) is out celebrating when she drunkenly crashes her car and kills two people. Four years later, Rhoda leaves prison and cross paths with John (William Mapother), the man whose life she ripped apart in the car accident. \nThis still remains such a clever take on the admittedly overdone premise. The writing is well paced and tackles big themes like grief, regret… \nmore",

This film, with its tragic hetero-romance, is as openly queer as it probably could be. Two kisses, and a crossdressing sequence. It somehow manages to convincingly have two women be in love, and two men, but with only three characters, because subtext can isolate moments and spin them into whole universes. In reality, she was in love with a woman and left not for a man but for herself. Hollywood tries in their own ways to honor that, but it's still laden with this unnecessary connection.

Edited by both Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker and partially shot by Scorsese himself, the documentary employed a cinéma vérité style that was reminiscent of other concert films of the time.\nIt was August 15, 1969.

Jean and Sara love each other. One day, Sara sees François in the street. He does not notice her, but she is overtaken by the sensation that her life could suddenly change. François gets back in touch with Jean. For the first time in years. He suggests they start working together again. From here on, things spiral out of control. ×\nBeing French is simply no way to live a life A white woman living in a post-colonial African country refuses to abandon her family’s coffee plantation even as civil war brews around her. A derelict spaceship full of criminals sails across the stars towards a black hole, adrift between their histories on Earth and the oblivion that awaits them in the cosmos. A former officer in the French Foreign Legion remembers his time stationed in Djibouti, where his men lost themselves in the desert (and each other) while preparing for a fight that never came.\nThe people in Claire Denis movies are seldom in a hurry, but they’re often out of time. They’re drawn and quartered between the soft flesh of memory and the acrid metal of waking life —… \nmore Euphoria High but they are middle aged and French. Sorry. It somehow made me think of Trouble Every Day more than any of Denis more grounded movies. It pretty much is about how camera negotiates space between two tense bodies and Denis usual formal excellence, editing and camera, are great at it. Both Sides of the Blade also suggest Denis stab at making a more balanced Pialat movie. Some great work from Binoche and Lindon even more so because so much of it is about how their bodies are positioned inside the frame. Relationships are hard. The first great movie about how the Covid pandemic turned everybody into a volatile, horny maniac Torn between Vincent Lindon and Grégoire Colin is probably a woman's luckiest dilemma. In Both Sides of the Blade, Claire Denis' newest messy romantic drama, Juliette Binoche tries to balance her affections towards two men, and it backfires in the most explosive manner possible. \nNot Denis' career best by any stretch, this still reeks of her trademarks of sentimentality, feminine identity and black experience, which eventually counterbalance all the flaws. Despite a lukewarm first half of slow-burn buildup, the story picks up pace in the second, amping up emotions, tensions and dramatic scenes to repay the long wait. Lindon and Binoche are great enough veterans to pull off the equal parts sensual and turbulent dynamics with ease, while Colin still has the look and charms to disturb the couple's perfect existence. Despite an unsatisfying closure, Both Sides of the Blade still serves its purpose beautifully as an engrossing arthouse drama. Recommended. I was the only person at my screening with any colour in their hair BERLINALE FILM 4\nPersonally, this ranks below titane as it doesn’t have enough ass shots of Vincent lindon “You’re my Rue d’Amsterdam wife.”\nI would have liked flashbacks to explain Sara’s (Juliette Binoche) former relationship and why she was drawn to François (Grégoire Colin). Sara interviews people on the radio and it reminded me of the movie \nC’mon C’mon\n. Scenes when Sara and Jean (Vincent London) were fighting seemed like César bait much in the same way that \nRevolutionary Road \nfelt like Oscar bait. It also channeled \nMarriage Story \nbut there was no wall-punching and the scenes were blocked better. \nAlso watch for director Claire Denis’ cameo in the party scene. Commuterland Paris, a casual domestic geography in familiar handheld, but the seasons are changing, skies are gray; everything is liminal, especially the world of sports, a zone in which established hierarchies of race and class become mutable (that’s why Denis stages a FaceTime call in which a member of France’s 1998 World Cup-winning squad explains Frantz Fanon).\nSome of the funniest, harshest and most accurate domestic arguments ever—the way Binoche leverages Lindon’s insecurity to turn offense into defense; the way the subject of the argument is invariably subsumed into a meta-argument about communication styles; “each sentence is a breath.” \nNeed to sit with this one but it strikes me as one of Denis’s major films, a complex synthesis of familiar themes like female erotic abandon, postcolonialism, nostalgia and spiritual unrest, mixed families, and the up-to-the-minute tactility of French life (the way Marcus’s mask outlines his lips…). I never thought I’d see a Denis film that would elicit in me little more than a tired “okay, boomer,” but here we are. Considering the world needs another film about tortured infidelity the way it needs another pandemic airborne illness, the film’s inherent uselessness can never quite save three moody, mercurial performances from feeling like they’re wasted on such tired material. One mid-film sequence stands out as the ghost of some more intense, special, strange film that might have been; Binoche struggling to balance the irrationality of her intensely corporeal responsiveness to even the sound of Colin’s voice with her very real emotional ties to Lindon, all of which Denis shoots like the stuff of some shadowy political thriller… \nmore",

    "Text": "An autobiographical film based on Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien’s memories of his youth growing up in Taiwan after emigrating from mainland China.\nBoiled down to synopses, all coming-of-age films are effectively the same: initial confrontations with love, death and desires that shape a protagonist's relationship to the world. Yet Hou Hsiao-hsien's version of this story is so singular it is as if I'd never seen one of these films before. His sense of visual time-keeping is singular, turning what is on paper a simple conceit (returning to the same spots from different camera angles) into something ineffably complex and poetic. His sense of history is likewise all his own, managing to ground his avatar against a backdrop of major social changes while fixating him within a context that so many Hollywood films attempt and come off as maudlin and condescending. Hou's histories… \nmore Some of the greatest films will make you feel right at home even though their settings are not exactly like your own. Culture specific as they may be, they have the sort of universality that can endear them to any person in any part of the world. They will make you feel nostalgic about times you have never lived through. The way they show life in all its pain and glory, through all the heartache and hopefulness, is downright magical. \nThe Time to Live and the Time to Die\n performs this magic to perfection. It is a nearly unmatched Asian family portrait, perhaps only matched by the two best Edward Yang works.\nWhat makes this all the more fascinating is… \nmore The movie begins with Hou's own voice recounting the story of his family's move from Mainland China first to Taiwan and then to the small southern town of Fengshan, spoken over a series of images that serve to familiarize us with the family, their home and its environs, elegantly setting the unhurried rhythm of the film that is to follow. The camera finally locates the ten or eleven year old Hou himself, known throughout the film by his nickname A-Ha, and tracks with him. Throughout the first half of the movie, A-Ha will occupy the center of the frame, the camera moving to keep its focus on the boy as he goes about his various adventures. In the second half,… \nmore",

While It's a Wonderful Life might be the greatest Christmas movie of all time, A Christmas Carol is likely the greatest Christmas story.\nGrowing up on the Albert Finney Scrooge, I am very familiar with the plotpoints, yet seeing it with this 50s British cast, I was particularly impressed by the performances. Alastair Sim plays a perfect Scrooge, in that he is both believable as grumpy Scrooge and happy Scrooge.\nThe story embodies so much of what is great about Christmas, from helping the poor to being generous and good to the people in your life. It takes a man with seemingly no redeemable qualities, makes you care about him, and turns him into a flawed but caring lead. It reminds you that it's never too late to change, and every day you choose to be the person you are.\nFantastic story, and an incredible adaptation. Scrooge\n is my default film adaptation of A Christmas Carol. It’s deliciously gothic. As others have noted it’s filmed like a Universal horror. Alastair Sim is the superior Ebenezer Scrooge in my opinion.",

A beautiful, poetic and emotional coming-of-age film that portraits kids and adults in a rural, harsh southern city landscape dealing with tragedy, boredom, loneliness and dreams, and a film more concerned about its tone, emotions and characters than a plot. The narration, the music, and the cinematography compliment each other so so well, and it's just a damn joy to lean back and watch this film. It has a Malick-esque feel to it, but it's still its very own little beautiful thing. I loved the \"I wish..\" monologue by Vernon. I loved this film.

The production tells Sayat-Nova’s dramatic story by using both his poems and largely still camerawork, creating a work hailed as revolutionary by Mikhail Vartanov.\nThere’s a pretty reassuring review on here that was something I knew before watching this but needed to hear again afterwards where it describes the visuals as “meaning whatever they mean to you.” This film is very personal, and how it is approached depends entirely on how you look at it. I found myself feeling so many different emotions throughout this thing. Excited, irritated, depressed, turned on, uncomfortable, you name it. It’s a film about this man’s life but is also incredibly personal to the viewer, with visuals so abstract yet so specific, you can’t argue that this doesn’t make you feel something. It’s using filmmaking in a way that feels so easy yet so mastered and reminded me how powerful this medium is. I got a very specific experience out of this and what’s so amazing about it is that I guarantee you will too, but it will most likely be completely different. cinema as poetry and poetry as cinema. a work so ingrained into the psyche of its subject that it requires every cell in your body to be tuned to its wavelength. if you do just that, you'll be rewarded with one of the most visually stunning and seriously beguiling films ever crafted. one of the only times where my inability to access parts of the \"plot\" (or in this case lyrical and poetic enchantments) enriches my experience; this was this mans life and only his to live. i will try to understand what i can, always...yet sometimes we can only be curious passerbys. a film i think that will only get better with age and experience. ***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***\nSayat Nova is two things for me: the life stages of a poet's life interpreted subjectively and visually rather than literally (through a straightforward narrative), and the representation of the Armenian culture in violent times, again seen through the eyes of the poet. Each stage of the film depicts the poet's life: his growth, his poetry depicting what his eyes saw about his mother Armenian culture, his life in a monastery, his discovery of eroticism, his immersion in literature, his death, everything with interruptions of Armenia's persecution.\nHaving troubles with the film because of its completely abstract and unexplained imagery?

Why? It already tells you in the title, to throw away your books and rally in the streets.\nBooks (and film, and games, and media in general) are important to be clear, but what is the reason one reads, watches, plays? Primarily it should be to educate, to help inform the recipient and improve their life, but often it ends up as a way of passing time. There is nothing wrong with entertainment but over-indulgence leads us to forget why we do it in the first place, as shown regularly in the film where intellectuals who spend all their time reading are the most disconnected from society.… \nmore ***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***\n“These youngsters are my age”, is the first thing that came to my mind. As the opening sequence has the protagonist speaking directly to us, embodying an eager sense of freedom devoid of impositions so long set by society and looking for a release after so much time, I identified. Three scenes later after the furious opening credits, this same young man is seen running over a railway in an endless reverse-moving tracking shot constantly shifting from left to right with the soundtrack playing loud. The film ends similarly, but with him screaming, also over a railroad, but this final shot is more self-controlled, as his strength gradually weakens. My… \nmore tw: rape\ni'm so fucking tired of political/experimental/art films exploiting the sexual trauma of women. there is a harrowing gang rape scene in this film that goes on for SO long and it made me feel physically ill to the point that i could barely stomach the rest of the film. wonder what it must be like for people who can watch this and come away from it praising the power of cinema as though they watched the ending 10 minutes in some kind of vacuum and the rest of the film with a numbness for the way terayama uses rape as a way to make a political statement that has no interest in the effects of trauma or really any concern for the female experience. but uhhh cool soundtrack and mid-shot aperture changes!",

As we get older, this urge to make things better for the ones we leave behind definitely gets stronger, so I could totally relate to the intent of the underlying theme.\nWinner of the '83 Cannes Palme d'Or, the film has that certain something that the Cannes people generally go all gaga over. Oodles of style, engaging characters and a great… \nmore At some points charming and at others downright terrifying \nThe Ballad of Narayama \nis a two hour roller coaster. Pure comedy is contrasted with some truly harrowing scenes that leave you fully enthralled from start to finish, and it is so god damn horny. (Foreign language film - Japanese)\nThat's the circle of life baby!\n\"No matter how hard life is here on Narayama, when the snow begins to fall she'll be released from pain.\"\nAfter spending far too long on the top of my BIG NEVER ENDING WATCHLIST, I finally checked out this very human portrait of the difficulty of life for the peasants of a remote mountain village in Japan. We get to follow the people of this village for a whole year leading up to one of their elderly members honoring the ritual of being carried up Mount Narayama to peacefully pass away.\n(Quick Hits) ...

Sono just took his hand away from the steering wheel and placed it on my shoulder, palm up, then asked if I felt \"in charge\", that's when I knew chances of me recovering from this trauma are slim. This is fifteen levels of fucked, and I feel like I should be desensitized to this sort of mania and depravity by now but news flash, I'm not, probably because the performances are so realistic you'd think the cast were held at gunpoint behind the camera, as usual I'm covered in sweat and had to pause… \nmore After shooting 15 movies and two TV shows this decade alone, hyper-prolific renegade filmmaker Sono Sion was rushed to a Tokyo hospital in February, where emergency surgery was performed to save his life. The gonzo auteur behind the gleefully demented likes of “Suicide Circle” and “Why Don’t You Play in Hell?” had just finished work on an unhinged Amazon Prime series called “Tokyo Vampire Hotel,” which may have been his wildest project thus far; high praise for someone whose previous career highlights include the likes of “Love Exposure” (a four-hour epic about a teenage Catholic who falls in with a secret cult of up-skirt panty photographers) and “Tokyo Tribe” (a hyper-violent rap opera about a gangster who torches an entire… \nmore a kinda film that makes u go \"what the fuck\" for its entire runtime When I chose this film, Netflix automatically started playing the English dubbed version. It's so annoying. After I double checked to make sure this wasn't Sion Sono's English language debut, I changed the language settings to Japanese audio with English subtitles.\nIt's about filmmakers who push the limits to get discovered intertwined with a story about girls who were best friends in high school. On board with the filmmakers at first, I soon became more interested in the girls' story. It's a pretty crazy ride filled with action, reversals, and more. Sion Sono is a solid filmmaker and he doesn't disappoint. \nVegan alert:\nKilling a guy then boiling and stewing him, then taking the \"soft meat\" and innards and liquefying them in a blender “Do you know what it feels like to kill someone?”\nA loosely based take on real life events of a serial killer in 1990’s Japan—and lesbian Romeo and Juliet.\nSono’s depiction of a narcissistic psychopath is deeply disturbing and often maddening, with vile methods of physical torture and mental manipulation, but works wonders in \nThe Forest of Love\n. A young group of wannabe filmmakers are convinced conman Joe Murata is a serial killer, they decide to film his biopic but find themselves trapped under his charming egotistical ways— we follow the sadistic conman that continually gets his way while playing and preying on whomever will fall under his “charming” spell. \n“\nI work really hard to turn my lies into reality.”\n…\n \nmore Action! - Love, Lust And Violence: Sion Sono's Inland Empire\n W/ \nThe Night Nutter\n, \nJoe Mighty Castillo\n, The Other Guys.... and \nJeff\n日本の女子高生ってすげー気持ち悪い\nSheer bleakness, pure depravity. Lars Von Trier is jealous and happy at the same time.\nMaybe it's simply because the editing and everything feels very tight, but the film version is much better than the extended version, even if a lot of what I learned in that version helped me appreciate certain situations at lots of times, such as in the bank scene. Also, while I understand why there is a scene of these people being savagely slain in the forest, after watching this version, I feel it wasn't necessary, and the back and forth transition between… \nmore Hated the treatment / use of female characters in this film. It was like watching a weird old man's fantasies for what felt like a whole day. It was sooo long and dragged out.\nI have not seen much of his work, but it was obvious to me that he was inspired by himself. As narcissistic as the main focus of the film.\nMaybe that's also why he had so many uninteresting references to Romeo & Juliet.\nWith that said, I am confident any fans of his, who know his filmography, will love the probable multiple shout outs he gives to himself. I only noticed ones from two of his films, but I am sure there are many more. I think,… \nmore It's my first time seeing a Sion Sono film and honestly, I don't know what to feel. \nIt's mad, perverted, disturbing, and just plain sick... yet I can't seem to take my eyes off the screen and still found myself captivated and intrigued on what's going on. But I don't know, the plot seems messy and convoluted and the characters were all unlikeable as hell. I can't believe I sat through this. “Did you love me, even just a tiny bit?”\nAn intensely sickening crime movie about an indie filmmaking crew trying to capture the life of an eccentric con man; Sion Sono’s 151 minute feature length cut of \nThe Forest of Love \nis a sporadic and extreme jumble of trauma, abuse, and major gore as its protracted plot messily unravels in this apparent condensation of the prolific filmmaker’s most indulgent tropes. However, it never fails to entertain; at times going too far or feeling too unfocused, but constantly building in severity and throwing new spanners into the works of its already shocking story. I can only imagine what else is added to the extended 248 miniseries cut, which I may get around to when I’m more familiar with Sono’s filmography, but as far as the movie goes I cant deny enjoying it. A 150 minute multi-wave orgasm over the moment where Juliet discovers a dead Romeo. \nThe Forest of Love\n is one of Sion Sono's best films, even though it is partially just him going through the motions. This is \nLove Exposure\n meets \nSuicide Club\n meets \nWhy Don't You Play in Hell?\n. There's also shades of \nNoriko's Dinner Table\n and \nStrange Circus\n. Sion Sono explores his usual intersection of love, sex, and art, whilst maintaining his penchant for schoolgirls and lesbianism.\nSono always plays on the boundary between fetishistic misogyny and a comment upon that topic. Here he is clearly making a statement. \nThe Forest of Love\n is a satire on influence and social control. Women are humiliated, made to want to… \nmore All-Time Favourites\nWhat makes ‘The Forest of Love’ great is not the maniacal, disturbing, electrifying atmosphere that only Sion Sono can create, it is because of the moments where the chaos halts, where the audience can see the pandemonium briefly turn into beautiful tranquility, allowing them to appreciate the tender tale being told amongst the bedlam.",

Watch \nL’Enfer\n and understand why it translates to ‘Hell’, since that’s exactly what it felt like watching it. Not because it was bad, but because Chabrol helps craft a skin-crawling story of emotional abuse and creates probably my least favourite character of all time.

    "Text": "The first part of an incomplete trilogy telling the story of the greek people. The film begins in 1919, with Greek immigrants from Odessa arriving near Thessaloniki. Led by the charismatic Spyros, they establish a new settlement in the delta of a river. The youngest of the settlers are Spyros’ son Alexis and an orphan from Odessa, Eleni. A strong, almost incestuous affection develops between the teenagers, resulting in twins who are given to a foster family. Also standing in the way of love is Spyros, determined to take his foster daughter as his wife. The lovers then decide to flee the village, persecuted by their father, leading a life of exile. As Alexis joins a group of musicians planning to go to the United States, Eleni regains custody of the twins. Angelopoulos, as in previous films, looks at the sacrifice of civilians confronted by the workers’ demonstrations of 1935, the rule of Metaxas’ fascist junta and forced emigration to America, and finally the civil war of 1944-1949. ×\nThe most romantic of Angelopoulos's films by filtering 20th-century Grecian history through the lens of lovers Eleni and Alexis. Unlike his other works, history is less of a direct actor and more of a supporting one, a force which acts upon these two without them able to respond in kind. All they can do is wait, survive, and persevere through the never-ending march of history, holding onto the hope that if they walk long enough they will eventually find their grassy meadow.

Through its masterful directing, methodical writing, incredible soundtrack and ASTOUNDING cinematography (seriously this shit looks picturesque throughout, even on some Barry Lyndon level shit), it surrounds this tragic yet familiar tale in Angelopoulos’ stylistic flair to tell it in the utmost fascinating and emotionally investing way. \nThe incredible coordination in the long takes once again leaves me in awe, as per… \nmore",

I like that this reverses the boilerplate \"crisis of conscience\" throughline, having a guy realize that his pristine ideals really aren't worth compromising, even though the beats sort of remain the same, which leaves room for a lot of welcome digression (like the vacation, or the way this noticeably takes place in a very recognizable sphere of runaway capital, institutional failure, and gentrification). Roman J. Israel, Esq was a strange movie. The execution & plotting could have been better and the story could have gone in multiple better directions but i was totally engrossed in the film the whole way through thanks to Denzel Washington's performance, this is a perfect example of slightly-above-average movie elevated by goddamned brilliant performance.",

Last week, in a moment of desperate optimism and/or extreme naïveté, this critic declared that “Mile 22” was “far and away the worst summer movie of 2018.” And while that statement was true at the time — and crucially made a clear exception for Dinesh D’Souza’s “Death of a Nation” — it failed to account for the season’s final batch of studio offerings, and the unfathomable awfulness that (at least) one of them had in store. \nDespite having worked in this business for long enough to know better, I foolishly assumed an incoherent and jingoistic Mark Wahlberg vehicle that climaxes with someone telling him to “say hi to your mother for me” would be… \nmore Lazy, dull, unfunny. Has no mood, character or atmosphere mostly because of the lighting and atrocious music choice. The puppets have no rules. The story is okay at times but the humour drags it down into the gutter. I really liked the performance of the main puppet voice actor, that's about it though. Just watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

Bennett Holiday is an American lawyer in charge of facilitating a dubious merger of oil companies, while Bryan Woodman, a Switzerland-based energy analyst, experiences both personal tragedy and opportunity during a visit with Arabian royalty. Meanwhile, veteran CIA agent Bob Barnes uncovers an assassination plot with unsettling origins.\nI don't care that nobody seems to understand the plot. I don't care that it's didactic. I don't care that \"serious people\" find the geopolitical analysis puerile. I love Stephen Gaghan's Syriana because it's the only American film to seriously and thoughtfully engage with the \"war on terror.\" Every other Hollywood product either exploits the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as an easy background for action scenes or to make rather banal points about the traumatic effects of war on those who fight them. Syriana, on the other hand, examines the moral implications of our oil-based economy with deftly intertwined stories of terrorists, CIA officers and sheiks. There's just enough time spent teasing out the characters to make you care… \nmore Seeing all the two-star reviews for this film on this site has left me feeling despondent. \"Syriana\" is one of the best films I've seen attempting to tackle the multifaceted fuckery of the CIA and the US state department's economic colonisation of the Middle East post-9/11. \nThis film, much like HBO's \"The Wire,\" looks at almost every level of the so-called 'War on Terror.' The film focuses on several loosely interlocking stories from a CIA agent played by George Clooney who gets burned, to Matt Damon finding himself becoming one of the Iranian Prince's top advisers after a personal tragedy. \nThis film covers the exploitation of oil companies and the deep-rooted corruption that spills out during a merger between two… \nmore Okay, so apparently George Clooney already had won an Oscar for his acting work and I didn't know.... now, I feel like my whole cinema being is a complete lie...\nBut seriously, I believe this movie came right or a year later before \"Munich\" came out. In this regard, its clear Spielberg's true political thriller is way much superior to this one in many aspects, both technical and acting wise.\nThat's not to say this is not a bad movie. Performances are all around great, and the story is decent, but at the same time if this is the film that gave Clooney his Oscar then its clear that was a career win.

But while Snyder recognized that Costner and Lane spark an old-fashioned vision of American values more potent than even Superman could express alone, the franchise-oriented “Man of Steel” couldn’t afford to consider that… \nmore Liked Thomas Bezucha's Let Him Go much more than I expected - boomer at heart here I guess.

Don Johnson is cooler than cool, Jennifer Connolly is cuter than cute and Virginia Madsen is an absolute sexpot, shaving her legs while on the phone, as well as driving around in a pink Cadillac. Everybody is sweating, smoking and shagging while spouting cool, sexy and seductive dialogue. And to top it all off, the whole runtime of this bad boy is accompanied by a slapping blues/jazz soundtrack. I really… \nmore sorry dennis hopper, i don't believe anyone would actually be dumb enough to cheat on the incarnated angel of beauty that is jennifer connelly Jennifer Connelly and Virginia Madsen are the main reason to watch this Dennis Hopper-directed neo-noir. They're both so damn sexy but Virginia Madsen is so sizzling hot that she almost melts the screen! Blackmailing Don Johnson with that accent and shaving her legs while on the phone really hits the spot. This is perhaps one of the sweatiest films I have ever seen everyone is sweating buckets clothes just drenched in sweat in this pressure cooker of a story. Simmers quite nicely until it finally explodes. It's an above-average neo-noir with good performances from the three main players even Don Johnson finds his level as sleazy and extremely horny criminal Harry Maddox. Loved the score and ending too! Hopper is at his very best here with the direction, well worth checking out this underrated gem. Jennifer Connelly please step on me 🤤 Thoroughly enjoyed this.

Last time I watched this, I wondered if 130 minutes was too excessive a running time for such pulp; now I feel it works just fine, a necessary choice to… \nmore A classic noir script updated with sultry nineties pulp and an extra helping of sleaze. The Hot Spot begins with Don Johnson's self confident drifter rolling into a Texas town and finding himself a job as a car salesman. Director Dennis Hopper succeeds at creating a hot and sticky atmosphere in the dusty little town, which really pays dividends as the plot starts to heat up as our drifter gets involved with two local females - Jennifer Connelly's sweet girl next door and Virginia Madsen's seductive femme fatale. Madsen in particular excels in the role. A thoroughly drawling over the top performance that fittingly exemplifies the hyper-stylized intensity of the rest of the movie. It's slow in places, but Hopper… \nmore Is there a greater year for a director to have two films than Dennis Hopper having Catchfire and The Hot Spot both release in 1990? I get why people balk at the 130 minute runtime on this one - the narrative sustains barely 2/3 of that - but there's few things I relish more than moody, sweaty, dusty neo-noirs where characters predominantly bullshit each other in between bed-breaking marathons and fisticuffs. The 80s and 90s Neo-Noir Project\nA bit of an old favourite from my younger days, but I think mostly due to the HUUUUGE crush I had on Jennifer Connelly there for about 2 years.\nPretty much anything she was in that I saw around that time became a favourite of some description, even Inventing The Abbotts, which was a boring load of old crap. Mind you, that had the added bonus of having Liv Tyler in it as she became my next huge crush over the next 2 years. It was a passing of the torch, if you will.\nOf course, Connelly is still absolutely stunning both in The Hot Spot and in the present day, but this rewatch… \nmore One of the biggest lies in the history of cinema is when Jennifer Connelly said \"I'm just ordinary\". \nNo.... You're extraordinary. Drifter Harry Madox takes a job as a used car salesman in a small Texas town. In the summer heat, he develops an interest in Gloria Harper, a young demure woman who works at the car dealership in the loan office. Dolly Harshaw, who is married to the dealership's owner, flirts shamelessly with Harry. Soon after they begin a torrid affair. Harry may be more than the simple drifter he at first appears, soon there's burning buildings, robbed banks and even murder.\nDon Johnson is outstanding as Madox, you see a performance like this and it's hard to work out why he never really had a huge film career.

Lithgow makes a terrific villain, totally having a blast matching Sly's every punch with a terrible quip. Bench-pressing a guy onto a stalactite has to be one of the all-time great action movie kills. No contrivance is omitted in its pursuit of cheap thrills.

Literally every trick in the book is deployed here, from (outstanding) matte-paintings to miniatures to rear-screen to good old fashioned practical stunts. It's Bond level, really a superb technical achievement. The plane-to-plane transfer sequence is worth it alone (and essentially remained unequaled until THE DARK KNIGHT RISES). Harlin's best movie in a walk.\nEdit: Can't believe I forgot to mention Rex Linn's constant, literally frothing-at-the-mouth apoplectic rage.

Sure, it’s a total \nDie Hard\n rip-off, but it’s got giant explosions, bloody kills (shoulder pressing a dude into a stalactite is “fuck yeah” incarnate), gorgeous mountain matte painting backdrops, and enough extreme climbing stunts to give cliffheads (is that a term?

I haven’t watched this in quite a few years and I almost forgot how much I love this movie—these are easily my favorite looking werewolves... the way they look with those tall slender almost extraterrestrial-esque looking bodies topped off by hulking death snout heads legitimately creep me out.\nBesides the wonderful effects work that made these moon beasts look like they could actually exist, Neil Marshall’s quick edits during those early scenes that give us juuuuuuuust enough intimidating glimpses of these demon wolf predators swiftly moving through fog drenched trees is… \nmore",

Mark Duplass and Ray Romano both give some GREAT performances in this that I already know will be insanely overlooked.  There were moments that felt so real and others that feel a little cliché and I would’ve liked some more consistency but damn. The end (\nthe scene\n) is one of the most heartbreakingly realistic things I’ve ever seen in film. Props to the performances and direction because it was truly unlike anything I’ve seen before. This was much better than I expected. This is great. \nThis is sweat.\nThis is touching.\nThis is heartwarming. \nThis is sad. \nThis is fun. \nThis is a beautiful friendship. “You always look sad when we finish.”\nI’m in love with this. I could’ve watched these guys hang out for so much longer, and I think that’s the point. Their time together isn’t particularly planned out or even all that eventful — no one moment feels so unique, but within each rambling conversation, you could just stay inside the warmth of it forever.

The camera swings and lingers with all the tension of a Blumhouse movie and the care of a French romance. I went “no no no no” every time a man was on the screen. Girls are made to grow up so fast. I was a grown-ass adult man in an office at the age of 23 scared to drive my big boy car to a local doctor on my insurance and figure out why I kept passing out at the office and here are these two baby girls born after the towers fell putting their lives in repeated danger for a peace of mind they should’ve always been afforded. Hell hell hell. Eliza Hittman has an attention to detail that, as proven here, can carry an entire film without words. Not just in the faces but in footsteps, blinks, and obviously hands. Even the smallest of actions speak so loudly. When something otherwise “normal” means something, you feel that difference. \nThere’s a specific shot near the beginning when Autumn is laying in the bed after her ultrasound exam. The camera follows her face as she turns to her side, facing away from the monitor. In the midst of a situation that’s left her no room to breath, she finds solace where she can, in that moment it’s on the other side of that bed. That solace redefines itself throughout the film, but proves itself present in every moment, even if that moment is in the middle of a shitty NYC train station.",

Is that an oxymoron? I don't know. I've found that while Kazan's films often feel clunky and dated, his leading men always feel startlingly contemporary. He was a brilliant actor's director, all right, and a pretty good hand at everything else.\nVisually, \nEast of Eden\n is absolutely beautiful. California really does look like Eden, which was obviously John Steinbeck's point. That's about the only theme from the novel that Kazan didn't feel the need to hammer to death, thank goodness.\nBut literally every other theme from Steinbeck's novel is highlighted, underlined, and double-underlined for our benefit.… \nmore",

Unfortunately, Bob soon learns that the game is rigged and the cops are on to him.\nAction! – Three Auteurs: In The Wavelength of Melville\nMelville still hasn’t come to his own entirely, but you can still see some traces of its future brilliance on display here. Also, whether it was intentional or not, the director would be setting up a lot of the things that would later become the French New Wave, so by default, it would not be wrong to call this film ahead of its time.\nThe film has also been cited as an influence for other modern movies such as \nOcean’S Eleven\n and \nHard Eight\n, and in some ways, you can see it. It lacks the energy and snappy editing of the former, especially, but a lot of the premise of this… \nmore Jean-Pierre Melville’s \nBob the Gambler \nis a proficiently constructed crime film which significantly delivers a playful spiritedness. It's a prototypal example of the French New Wave movement as well as exhibiting a clear lineage to later films such as \nOcean's Eleven\n and features some distinctly different camera angles and a soundtrack that incorporates an assortment of genres, from exotic jazz to more traditional accordion music.\nCinematographer Henri Decae does some tremendous work, and the atmosphere of Place Pigalle, a public square at the foot of the Montmartre hill, at daybreak is exquisite. It's this deeply romanticised view of the city that assists a very melancholic performance from Roger Duchesne (as Bob) in a fairytale-like storyline of a man discovering himself broke and thinking about one last heist. This film is stunning to look at and captures the magnificence of Paris in the mid-fifties. Early crime film from Jean-Pierre Melville, which the director himself called his \"love letter to Paris\". The opening showcases the city and introduces the title character. Bob is an aging compulsive gambler, who lives by night; one gamble to the next until he decides to take the ultimate gamble in the form of robbing a casino. Fortune favours the brave! The film is slow paced and effortlessly cool, Melville's attention to detail permeating every scene. The film favours visual storytelling over words, with the exception of Melville's own narration which chimes in at times. Bob le Flambeur is structured like a typical crime flick - planning a heist, one last score, crossed loyalties and an element of \"cherchez la femme\"… \nmore",

From the pre-credits sequence to the Bond song to Roger Moore and Barbara Bach and Richard fucking Kiel to the UNDERWATER LAIR and the stunts and the cars and the locations. \nThe Spy Who Loved Me\n just has it all, you know?… \nmore \"Moneypenny, where's 007?\"\n\"He's on a mission sir. In Austria.\"\n\"Well, tell him to pull out. Immediately.\"\nMy favorite of the Roger Moore Bonds.\nIf you ever need proof for the theory that the Bond movies work as time capsules, transforming the formula to fit the tastes of the time, you need look no further than \nThe Spy Who Loved Me\n. It screams late 70's the same way the tacky special effects of the Brosnan Bonds scream late 90's. The cinematography is dark and stylized, imitating the neo-noir aesthetic of directors like Alan Pakula (\nThe Parallax View\n). The soundtrack is a blend of funky slide guitar and early synth, marking the height of disco's popularity. There's even an undefeatable character… \nmore M here again. As you were. Been pulling some overtime here to catch up. \nThe Spy Who Loved Me\n is everything you want out of a Bond film and is nearly flawless. Though the plot seems oddly familiar and has absolutely nothing to do with the book from which it is based, there is a ton to enjoy and the tropes are operating to perfection. With memorable music and characters, this film will be tough to beat. What follows is my mission debriefing, I hope you enjoy.\nThe Opening\n: Some submarines get jacked, dammit I’m going to have to deal with the Russians again.

It takes two points, whether those points be birth and death, love and hate, New York and LA, and examines the in between. It’s comprised of small moments, small notes, each providing a singular mood that, when put together, combines into a larger, more spastic piece. But there’s precision to that. These notes aren’t thrown together at random, one note always goes hand in hand with the next in a melodic way. It’s a series of different notes played from the same piano, each making it obvious through their sound that they come from the same instrument. It’s why when ‘The Meyerowitz Stories’ ends with a piece with strings, you feel the difference. These once singular sounds blend into something grander, something warmer. A newly-found sense of togetherness. \"If he's not a great artist, that means he's just a prick.\" Gerwig's influence on Baumbach cannot be understated. This has almost every staple of his earlier work (primarily the male existential anxiety and familial fallout) but there's a sharpness to the editing rhythm + compositions and a kindness in the writing, a maturity and generosity that deepens the characters and comedy where the anger and cruelty of his earlier efforts would've undermined them.

Viridiana becomes undone as her uncle upends the plans she had made to join the convent.\nViridiana isn't a good person. She's barely a person. She may seem virtuous and humble but at the core there's a self-righteousness that's prideful and disgusting. Bunuel was a known Anti-Catholic. It's not in the subtext but in the overtures. At the surface, Viridiana is about a nun falling from the grace of God, but it's the characters around her who are pure.

The infamous dinner party scene becomes a microcosm of Spain's political environs: the bourgeois fascist state is a juvenile food fight where the guests have no respect for the house, where they trash the place, stuff their faces, and fuck in the corner, destroying everything in their irreverent bacchanalia. \n\"I was so happy… You ruined everything.\"\nLuis Buñuel",

No stranger to politics, Cheney’s impressive résumé includes stints as White House chief of staff, House Minority Whip and Defense Secretary. When Bush wins by a narrow margin, Cheney begins to use his newfound power to help reshape the country and the world.\nVICE is an *incredibly* damning portrait of Dick Cheney, in that verrrrry few people could inspire a movie this bad — this self-satisfied, this tonally incoherent, this misjudged — and *still* not have it rank among the 10 worst things they’ve ever done.\nAdam McKay was an “important\" filmmaker until the moment he started trying to become one. i have endless faith that he’ll figure things out, but these recent history disaster satires (disastires?) aren’t it. There are of course pieces of this that are funny and clever and maybe even occasionally startling...look man, it's hard to argue that it isn't at least engrossing. But don't be fooled, just like THE BIG SHORT this is another McKay film about how you aren't mad enough or informed enough, not as smart or caustic or active as you should be. The idea that nobody knew Dick Cheney was evil human garbage consumed by the pursuit of power and/or money and was responsible for the \"legal\" taking of, what, how many untold thousands of lives (an accusation it literally directly levels at the audience) is, to put it mildly, completely fucking smug and condescending. I guess we were collectively… \nmore Ugggghhhh I’m too young and uninformed about politics to understand how much of this was accurate or how good of a job they did at portraying Dick. So with that being said I guess that’s why I like it a bit more than the rest of Letterboxd. I loved the performances, I actually dug how unsubtle it is, despite some messiness and a few cringey scenes I’m sorry to say that I genuinely enjoyed this.",

It conjured up so many often conflicting emotions in me that I hesitated to give it the full stars in fear I’d lost the true power in the meshes of my brain, but I think varying reactions is the intention.

She embarks on a vengeful quest to eliminate Bill and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who betrayed her.\nRegal Pyramid Mall Cinemas, Ithaca, NY\nOctober 10, 2003\nI drove a black Saturn SL1 to the mall. The car belonged to my girlfriend, although we were broken up at the time. This is relevant because we weren’t apart long and would eventually spend the rest of our lives together. We were in college, she in Baltimore, me in Western New York. How I got the car amidst “the break” is beyond me. Her dad owned it, technically, I was just the boyfriend. But I was happy to have it.

It was originally envisioned as a massive, four hour action epic, complete with full color massacre scenes, until Tarantino declared that it was too long for mainstream audiences and decided to split it into two. To make things worse, the MPAA refused to give Kill Bill a desired R rating because of the ultra bloody scenes. To compromise, Tarantino made the offending scenes black and white, to make the blood less pronounced (I guess) and since then, the original uncut version has been all but lost.\nBut apparently they do still show it at festivals, and Tarantino has plans to bring the full cut to… \nmore I've got a lot wrapped up in this emotionally. It's a foundational moment in one of my very best friendships, and VOL. 1 came out just a couple months after I started working at Scarecrow, just full to bursting with references to movies I was just beginning to learn how to love. At the time, I thought I'd been waiting my whole life to see KILL BILL. Then I waited almost the same amount of time again to see this version, which is just incalculably great and the only way it should ever be watched. Even the makeshift home version you can cobble together if you have the right discs doesn't hold a candle to the real thing. While I was watching it at the Vista last night it was the best movie I have ever seen, and certainly the screening was one of the best moviegoing experiences I have ever had.",

But of course, it doesn't last. As Germany picks itself up, its interior rots from the core outward.",

The performances are terrific, and there's a lot of passion and emotion to the story. But what impressed me more was how thoroughly this film sinks into a local culture, capturing everything from the shifting tides of politics in a newly democratic environment to the unspoken presence of a cult that appears at transitional rituals like funerals. This is a very lived-in film, a convincing portrait of a society rather than the kind of glossy abstraction that comes out of so many based-on-a-true-story situations, and as a first feature, it's just stunning. Oscar-nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor originally planned to stay behind the camera in his solid but somewhat uninvolving directorial debut, but it’s easy to understand why felt he compelled to star: Trywell Kamkwamba is one of the more fascinating characters he’s ever played.\nAn uneducated Malawian farmer who strives to provide schooling for his children, Trywell is too dignified to sell the family’s ancestral land to the tobacco business, and too savvy to think he can redeem his future by surrendering his past. He’s an honest man in a village that’s being choked to death by corruption, and — as a national food crisis takes hold — Trywell grows too desperate to see that his young son William (Maxwell Simba) might… \nmore i like the part where the boy harnessed the wind",

As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend. ×\nIt can be misleading to call a movie “critic-proof.” When this critic humbly concedes that “Rampage” is critic-proof, it’s not because the Rock could open a movie with a Rotten Tomatoes score of negative 12% and still cook up a small fortune. No, “Rampage” is only critic-proof because it’s one of the few studio films in recent history that’s too hollow to support any critical thought.

Drifting from place to place in a tumultuous era, the peace-seeking monk eventually gains a reputation for his art. But after Rublev witnesses a brutal battle and unintentionally becomes involved, he takes a vow of silence and spends time away from his work. As he begins to ease his troubled soul, he takes steps towards becoming a painter once again.\n\"What is praised today is abused tomorrow. \nThey will forget you, me, everything.\" \nI am utterly incapable of writing a review for this film, so I am not even going to try. It would be a disservice to the film, and to Tarkovsky. This is what I like to refer to as biblical cinema; I don't mean that the film itself is religious - at times it is, though I would argue its themes are more spiritual than religious... what I mean is that it is the type of film that you can revisit throughout your life - in times of need, in times of stress, in times of sorrow, you can come to a film like this one, and… \nmore Seven episodes in the life of the titular medieval Russian icon painter, all of which add up to one of the most vivid and detailed cinematic depictions I've ever seen of the life of an artist. From naive optimism about human nature to an abject despair that leads him to swear off art-making for about 15 years, then finally a renewal of his passion with the help of a former monk and a young bellmaker (whose obsessive quest to finish a massive bell acts as a metaphor for the artistic process), Andrei Rublev—at least in Andrei Tarkovsky's interpretation of his life—remains consistently engaged with the world around him; in such a context, the moment where he pointedly wonders aloud if… \nmore ***One of the best 150 films I have ever seen.***\nThanks to the power and humanism of a gripping anti-war manifesto called \nIvanovo Detstvo\n (1962) directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, his next epic project \nAndrey Rublyov\n had a considerable amount of high expectations from the Russian audience. Naturally, something that continues happening even nowadays, the film surpassed any possible human expectation, being the cinematic result a politically brutal and violent motion picture. The most obvious consequence was the film being prohibited by the Russian government for approximately three years, complicating a wider worldwide distribution while being subject to several edited versions mostly removing every scene involving profanity, its greatly predominant Catholic influence and the noticeably violent torture and battle sequences.

For one thing, it's neatly divided in half, with the first 30 or so minutes devoted to precise, small-scale comedy (favorite bit this time: Keaton twice retrieving the lawyer's spectacles as the will is read and the page is turned to reveal the sum bequeathed, then transferring them to his own face when he can't believe it's $7 million) and the next 30 constituting the medium's greatest (mostly) foot chase. There's admittedly a tinge of sexism to the premise—it's hard to imagine a woman running frantically from hundreds of angry men in tuxedos being very funny—but I can't hold that sort of relatively benign prejudice against the 1920's. For more, take a look at the \nScenic Routes column\n I wrote some time back.

Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA. Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in partnership with New York Women in Film & Television in 2004. ×\nlong live unions. no matter the outcome 40 years later, a group of the proletariat, labelled as uneducated and worth less than dirt, organised and fought a corporation for over a goddamn year for what was right. their bravery is raw and real and inspirational even today, because we still need unions and solidarity amongst the marginalised and working classes, to try and change anything. while the mines are mostly gone and the environment of America is nothing like what it once was, this proves that everyday people can come together and make a change, and that nothing is more powerful than a collective of human spirit. this made me cry my eyes out, a testament to the power of documentary filmmaking at its finest. I don't think it's any coincidence that the role of women in the strike is so well documented by a female director (and a team of female editors). “I knew the company was the enemy”\nIt really is unfathomable to me that we just straight up do not teach the labor history of America in schools. Like nothing. You can go through an entire K-12 education in America without so much as learning what a union is. Truly one of the most propagandized societies in human history!",

Eastwood's direction is very laidback and far more concerned with mood and colourful characters than actual plotting or murder. The milieu/atmosphere and eccentricities of the city are the best part of the film. John Cosack is good, Lady Chablis gives a scene stealing performance and Kevin Spacey is just playing himself. Based on a true crime story! What makes this film intriguing has nothing to do with the murder, it has everything to do with its colorful characters! And I kid you not these characters exist in real life!\nThe lovely, flamboyant trans woman Lady Chablis whom just happens to play herself in the film!\nLuther Driggers the man whom walked around with flies buzzing all around him (They were attached to him via string)! Oh yeah he also carries a vial full of poison just like he does in the film!\nMinerva the local voodoo high priestess!\nMr. Glover the man walking a dead dog named Patrick!\nI'm a sucker for strong character driven plots and this film is bursting at the seams with quirky, eccentric characters that don't just add flavor to the story.. they are the story!",

But honestly, the best detail of them all is somehow Robert Ryan's red baseball cap, which to me adds this tinge of dastardly boyishness to everything here—for its horror, the group politics at play throughout is essentially juvenile.

Ambas se complementam: Tatá Werneck é uma metralhadora de piadas, já Ingrid Guimarães segura o potencial dramático do filme. Entretanto, ainda que funcione nesse estilo que busca o riso em espaços curtos de tempo, Minha Irmã e Eu explora uma estrutura que não vulgariza essas escolhas. Um road movie que, a medida que avança, vai adaptando seu estilo, não deixando cair numa mesmice que prejudicaria essa busca incessante pelo riso. a cena da tatá convencendo a moça que ela e a ingrid eram um casal foi o auge do cinema brasileiro, amei!!",

You’ve never seen Howards End. I want to show it to you.”\nOne likes what one likes, oftentimes without knowing why. Quality is important, to be sure, and can cut through antagonistic predispositions. But attraction is something ineffable and frequently inexplicable. You may not be able to say what it is you love about the object of your affection, but of that love you have no doubt.\nFor a long time, I couldn’t say precisely why I loved \nHowards End\n. Perhaps it was its European literary vintage and the sheen of sophistication it offered. Perhaps it was the precision of the plotting, with threads interweaving and resolving like clockwork without seeming forced… \nmore so textured, so lovely. I like that there's a little more Tibby here than in the book. quite understandably and deservingly Emma Thompson took home the Oscar for this one, but Helena Bonham Carter is just as wonderful here too. \nalso \"I hate my banker father's younger socialist girlfriend\" feels like an extremely prescient villain arc in the year 2019 Oh wow this is what Downton Abbey was trying so hard to be",

Shot in stunning color and set in a suburb of Tokyo where housewives gossip about the neighbors’ new washing machine and unemployed husbands look for work as door-to-door salesmen, this charming comedy refashions Ozu’s own silent classic I Was Born, But . . . to gently satirize consumerism in postwar Japan. ×\nthe little boy’s “i love you”s 🥺 Oh, I loved this.

Bogart (and motherfucking *Pard*) are aces, as is Lupino with her eyelashes for days, but the accoutrement lets them down. the stuff with the crippled girl is thematically invaluable, but the hokum involved in setting it up and knocking it down is a bit much... stretches the innocence that Earle is looking for, and the redemption he's hoping to siphon from it. a lot of the small stuff doesn't connect, but Earle's slow tumble down the mountain (metaphorically speaking) is fine. \nmostly astonished by the speed with which Raoul Walsh gets things going... hurry up and wait, with some of the quickest fades in film history. a breakneck pace to let Earle self-destruct in slow-motion. “High Sierra” is Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino setting the stock standards for the next decade of noir. Also, it was Bogart’s genius excuse to make a whole film into ‘bring your dog to work day.’ \nBogart’s turn in “Sierra” as former bank robber Roy Earle blends the wild 30s Hollywood gangster spirit into a more nuanced portrait of an unsuccessfully reformed criminal. Where movies made lawbreakers part of the rebellious cool of Americana in the decade prior, the cons were generally little more than archetypical tricksters. They had only foibles; not humanity. \nBogart’s Earle is a wiseguy with a soul. And a cute dog (Bogart’s own; Zero). It’s Bogart taking everything he’d learned in the Warner gangster stable and imbuing… \nmore Marking the moment when the gritty gangster sagas of the 1930s began giving way to the romantic fatalism of 1940s film noir, High Sierra also contains the star-making performance of Humphrey Bogart, who, alongside top-billed Ida Lupino, proved his leading-man mettle with his tough yet tender turn as Roy Earle. A career criminal plagued by his checkered past, Earle longs for a simpler life, but after getting sprung on parole, he falls in with a band of thieves for one last heist in the Sierra Nevada. Directed with characteristic punch by Raoul Walsh—who makes the most of the vertiginous mountain location—Roy and Lupino’s Marie, a fellow outcast also desperate to escape her past, hurtle inexorably toward an unforgettable cliffside climax and a rendezvous with destiny.\nThis edition arrives on October 12, 2021.

Sin embargo, al tratarse de una película sobre los desafíos de ser inmigrante y la idealización del sueño americano, resulta decepcionante. \nLa idea de contar esta historia a través del mundo de la cocina es fantástica, y a medida que avanza la trama, el ritmo se vuelve caótico, creando una ansiedad extrema, lo cual tiene intención y funciona bien. El problema surge cuando, al intentar abordar temas como inmigración, clases sociales y roles de género (donde tiene varios aciertos), el personaje principal resulta tan INSUFRIBLE que nunca logras empatizar con él. Al contrario, termina reforzando los estereotipos del mexicano promedio como machista, misógino y violento, llevándote incluso a simpatizar más con el gringo. Es un gran concepto con momentos logrados, pero que al final deja un sabor bastante amargo. “Hoy amanecí chueco.”\n“Del cuerpo?”\n“Del alma, eso es más difícil de enderezar.”\nWild how this film feels like it’s trying (and failing miserably) to say so many things and yet the only important lesson it reinforced on myself was that you should never eat at a Times Square restaurant. Maybe 30 minutes too long.\nThat scene where there is cherry coke flooding the entire kitchen? Phenomenal.\nThe guy going on and on about his weird ass alien dream? Could be cut down.\nAn amazing cast, everyone shining despite the large roster of characters.",

Orgiastically blending the muted cool of a Jean-Pierre Melville neo-noir with the explosive melodrama of a Martin Scorsese crime epic and the florid grandiosity of a Chinese opera, Woo’s elevated style clashed with the meat-and-potatoes ethos of American blockbusters (“Face/Off” endures as a crucial exception, in large part because its story was as heightened as the way that Woo chose to tell it). The same ecstasy… \nmore This was never gonna be another smoldering violent romantic opera masterpiece. It's got more of a caper-ish ONCE A THIEF tone.

MacKendrick’s production design is ripped right out of the darkest crags of German expressionism. Granny was living in the lair of Dr. Mabuse this whole time. \nPart of \nWarm Fuzzies Winter\n. The confliction between old fashioned and the slightly pretentious values of Britain with more contemporary ones was one of the critical components that Ealing comedies controlled with authority, and \nThe Ladykillers \nis a crucial testimony to that. Directed by Alexander Mackendrick (\nSweet Smell of Success\n) and starring Ealing regular Alec Guinness as the impressively devious and intimidating Professor Marcus, the leader of a crime ring.\nIt's furthermore inhabited with some great supporting actors including an early screen performance from Peter Sellers, and the studio, as usual, delivers the material with impressive delicacy and skill; earning its screenwriter, William Rose, a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the 29th Academy Awards. \nThe Ladykillers\n is an excellent example of the prestigious and beloved studio firing on all cylinders with well-written dialogue and a succession of metaphors for the state of the British isles after WWII.",

Desire is the theme of all life!\nLimelight\n, a deeply personal film Charlie Chaplin directed later in his career, tells the moving story of an ill and deeply unhappy ballerina who is nursed back to both mental and physical health by a comedian whose years of glory are long behind him.

The film's staged-looking production design lends it a theatrical quality, heightening the surreal nature of the whole thing; the palace's big white columns, empty spaces, and plenty of dark corners provide a striking contrast to the film's colorful costumes and makeup, particularly Himiko's striking red dress.

The horse, Seabiscuit, doesn't actually make an appearance until at least an hour into the movie, but director Gary Ross does an impressive job of setting up the characters and establishing the setting.

Part of the problem, as I noted in my initial review from Cannes, is that Farhadi keeps hammering his theme home via dialogue, which really made me cringe in the home stretch this time. (\"Now I want to talk about the present. The past is gone.\" Clumsy translation, maybe, but still, c'mon, Asghar. We saw the title on the poster walking in.) But I was also mindful of the fact that more than one critic has charged Farhadi with misogyny. Which seemed insane, and in fact \nis\n insane—that's not a word that should be… \nmore Yet another family drama wherein the master dramatist impresses you with his magnificent storytelling and characterizations. The way he manages to create a complicated web of crisis through a simple divorce proceeding and a mix of children belonging to different cultures and bloodlines is something extraordinary. The human nature gets explored in an intrinsic manner, be it the complexity of guilt or the impossibility of letting things go. The final shot with an ambiguous end beautiful sums things up.
