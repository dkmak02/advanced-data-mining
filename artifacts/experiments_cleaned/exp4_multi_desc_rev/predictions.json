Timid and safe with a network TV aesthetic that screams “I’m a lot more afraid behind the camera than I am in front of it.” Not so of Kristen Stewart’s “The Chronology of Water.” Not in the slightest. Some movies are shot. This one was directed. \\nWhich isn’t to suggest this aggressively fragmented adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir should be graded on a curve because its famous auteur dared to film on 16mm, or even because she had the skill required to adapt her source material with the same febrile porousness that made it such a striking piece… \\nmore', 'I really do live for movies made entirely by people who have torn their hearts out. You can tell, there’s so \\nmuch\\n\\xa0in this (inevitable with such a life). Kept thinking about Jennette McCurdy’s memoir as well tbh. Truly believe every single shot has a hell of a lot to say, there are a lot of them and I could honestly watch them as a photo book with fewer words, but I was moved quite a few times.', 'THE CHRONOLOGY OF WATER floored me from start to finish with its fragmented but precise editing, uncompromising vision, and the raw, fearless performance of Imogen Poots, delivering her finest work yet. This is a pure art house biopic that scratches, pierces, and digs under the skin, confronting the viewer with a blistering emotional intensity that some may find too much to bear. To that end, Kristen Stewart’s directorial debut is unflinching & abrasive, a grueling exploration of pain that’s as likely to move you as it is to leave you shaken.']",

A young group of wannabe filmmakers are convinced conman Joe Murata is a serial killer, they decide to film his biopic but find themselves trapped under his charming egotistical ways— we follow the sadistic conman that continually gets his way while playing and preying on whomever will fall under his “charming” spell.\\xa0\\n“\\nI work really hard to turn my lies into reality.”\\n…\\n \\nmore', \"Action! - Love, Lust And Violence: Sion Sono's Inland Empire\\n W/ \\nThe Night Nutter\\n, \\nJoe Mighty Castillo\\n, The Other Guys.... and \\nJeff\\n日本の女子高生ってすげー気持ち悪い\\nSheer bleakness, pure depravity.

However, it never fails to entertain; at times going too far or feeling too unfocused, but constantly building in severity and throwing new spanners into the works of its already shocking story.

Her voiceover structures this interior pilgrimage; dissolves and fades to black demarcate each block of the past. She remembers her impolite questions, her naïve mistakes. She recalls the acoustics and the softness of the light in each room of her family's house. She dwells with objects: hand-colored photos, a skein of red yarn, her father's pendulum.

At the time, I thought I'd been waiting my whole life to see KILL BILL.

Soon tensions in the family and unwanted attention from a trio of suitors leave Letty increasingly disturbed.\n['A reminder that westerns were \"revisionist\" pretty much from the start. The frontier rendered as a hellscape of billowing sand, rain and snow, buffeting an increasingly unhinged Lillian Gish, who puts in her most expressionistic performance as a beleaguered woman swept around until she cannot think straight. This is the West as a literal howling void, a realm that exists as an unceasingly hostile force of nature outside what few shelters have been erected to protect settlers from a world so much bigger than they. The climax, of Gish being so violently buffeted that the film turns into an extended hallucination while maintaining Sjöstrom\\'s paradoxical brutal realism, is among the scariest sequences of the silent era.', \"#Watchlist 2021\\n'There's nothing out there.

Our characters are already so iconic in their traits that creating a humble hangout film feels like a natural progression in the Star Trek series. The heroes are obviously involved in the imminent threat, but the audience is carried away by slack scenarios and sublime mini narratives; slices of comedy which could only be achieved by a molecular understanding of these personalities. The hilarious chemistry is built around this team, their pasts, and the iconic energy their adventures hold, and even when the tone couldn\\'t be breezier, it feels authentic. You\\'d have to be a double dumbass not to enjoy this.', \"Insane that this works. On paper it's a mess. A bunch of visibly aging people from the future travel back in time to save two whales and the whole thing has a lightly comedic fish-out-of-water tone. What if this was the first Star Trek anything? I'll tell you what if: it would work. I know because this is the first Star Trek thing I saw as a kid. That's not totally true. I saw Worf at Paramount King's Dominion when I was, like, three. There's a picture out there somewhere of some actor holding me while I scream bloody murder because I didn't know who Worf was and that he was no threat to me as long as I didn't… \\nmore\", 'can you imagine a fourth entry in a lucrative franchise taking a hard swerve into comedy like this these days? although it\\'s certainly choppy since it\\'s still got a goofy, expository and \"relevant\" sci-fi adventure to deal with, you put a few beers in me and i\\'ll start arguing for it as a Hawksian hangout movie born inadvertently out of nostalgic familiarity and outright fan service.']",

Bleak cinematography with many unforgettable shots including a 17 minute long unbroken scene at a town hall meeting where the film’s themes finally crystallize in a simmering combustion of anger, frustration, fear & hatred. It took a bit to get going and I’m not sure everything coalesces as Mungiu suspects between Matthias‘ journey and the journey of the community. Still, it has one of the best third acts of the year with a final shot that knocked me on my ass. Will probably be thinking about this one for quite some time.']",

That is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen in cinema. \\nThe Human Centipede 2 takes everything you love about a good film, whether that be a fantastic story, progressive character development, or thrilling scenes; and throws it in a trash compactor. \\nThis film is just Tom Six saying \"I can make the grossest film ever, and it doesn\\'t have to be entertaining in the least!\" \\nOkay Tom, we get it. \\nPoop is gross.']",
